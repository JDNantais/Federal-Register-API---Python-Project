The privacy framework in these rules focuses on transparency, choice, and data security, and provides heightened protection for sensitive customer information, consistent with customer expectations. The rules require carriers to provide privacy notices that clearly and accurately inform customers; obtain opt-in or opt-out customer approval to use and share sensitive or non-sensitive customer proprietary information, respectively; take reasonable measures to secure customer proprietary information; provide notification to customers, the Commission, and law enforcement in the event of data breaches that could result in harm; not condition provision of service on the surrender of privacy rights; and provide heightened notice and obtain affirmative consent when offering financial incentives in exchange for the right to use a customer's confidential information.

99-20683,"This notice offers interested parties an opportunity to comment on clarifying changes to a proposed revision to OMB Circular A- 110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations.'' Public Law 105-277 directs OMB to amend Section __.36 of the Circular ``to require Federal awarding agencies to ensure that all data produced under an award will be made available to the public through the procedures established under the Freedom of Information Act'' (FOIA). Pursuant to the direction of Public Law 105-277, OMB published a Notice of Proposed Revision on February 4, 1999. OMB received over 9,000 comments on the proposed revision. Many of these comments raised serious concerns about the impact Public Law 105- 277 and the proposed revision would have on the conduct of scientific research. In part, these concerns arose from questions as to how expansively or narrowly the proposed revision would be interpreted and applied. In raising these questions, commenters on both sides of the debate sought clarification of four concepts found in the proposed revision: ``data,'' ``published,'' ``used by the Federal Government in developing policy or rules,'' and cost reimbursement. In response to these comments, and in order to advance implementation of the requirements of Public Law 105-277, OMB has developed proposed clarifying definitions for the first three of these concepts and is providing additional background discussion regarding the fourth. In framing these definitions, OMB has used its discretion to balance the need for public access to research data with protections of the research process. Specifically, OMB seeks to further the interest of the public in obtaining the information needed to validate Federally-funded research findings, ensure that research can continue to be conducted in accordance with the traditional scientific process, and implement a public-access process that will be workable in practice. OMB will consider all comments received in response to this notice, and the comments received in response to the prior notice, in its development of the final revision to the Circular. OMB intends to publish the final revision on or before September 30, 1999. It is not necessary to re-submit comments already provided to OMB.",Request for Comments on Clarifying Changes to Proposed Revision on Public Access to Research Data.,"[{'raw_name': 'OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET', 'name': 'Management and Budget Office', 'id': 280, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/management-and-budget-office', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/280.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'management-and-budget-office'}]",['Management and Budget Office'],,1999-08-11,,,"OMB Circular A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations''",[],Notice,Data Science
