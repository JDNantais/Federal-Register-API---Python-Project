2016-14728,"The General Services Administration (GSA) is amending the General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) to include clauses that require vendors to report transactional data from orders placed against certain Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contracts, Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), and Governmentwide Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Transactional data refers to the information generated when the Government purchases goods or services from a vendor. It includes specific details such as descriptions, part numbers, quantities, and prices paid for the items purchased. GSA has experimented with collecting transactional data through some of its contracts and found it instrumental for improving competition, lowering pricing, and increasing transparency. Accordingly, GSA will now test these principles on a broader base of its contracting programs. This move supports the Government's shift towards category management by allowing it to centrally analyze what it buys and how much it pays, and thereby identify the most efficient solutions, channels, and sources to meet its mission critical needs. GSA will introduce a new Transactional Data Reporting clause to its FSS contracts in phases, beginning with a pilot for select Schedules and Special Item Numbers. Participating vendors will no longer be subject to the existing requirements for Commercial Sales Practices (CSP) disclosures and Price Reductions clause (PRC) basis of award monitoring, resulting in a substantial burden reduction. Stakeholders have identified the CSP and PRC requirements as some of the most burdensome under the Schedules program. These actions represent the most significant change to the Schedules program in the past two decades. GSA has also created a Transactional Data Reporting clause for all new GWACs and Governmentwide IDIQ contracts and may apply the clause to any existing contracts in this class that do not contain other transactional data requirements.",Final rule.,"[{'raw_name': 'GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION', 'name': 'General Services Administration', 'id': 210, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/general-services-administration', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/210.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'general-services-administration'}]",['General Services Administration'],2016-06-23,2016-06-23,True,,General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR); Transactional Data Reporting,['Government procurement'],Rule,Data Analytics

2015-30690,"Publication of the Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions and the Regulatory Plan represent key components of the regulatory planning mechanism prescribed in Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review'' (58 FR 51735) and incorporated in Executive Order 13563, ``Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review'' issued on January 18, 2011 (76 FR 3821). The fall editions of the Unified Agenda include the agency regulatory plans required by E.O. 12866, which identify regulatory priorities and provide additional detail about the most important significant regulatory actions that agencies expect to take in the coming year. In addition, the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that agencies publish semiannual ``regulatory flexibility agendas'' describing regulatory actions they are developing that will have significant effects on small businesses and other small entities (5 U.S.C. 602). The Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified Agenda), published in the fall and spring, helps agencies fulfill all of these requirements. All federal regulatory agencies have chosen to publish their regulatory agendas as part of this publication. The complete Unified Agenda and Regulatory Plan can be found online at http://www.reginfo.gov and a reduced print version can be found in the Federal Register. Information regarding obtaining printed copies can also be found on the Reginfo.gov Web site (or below, VI. How Can Users Get Copies of the Plan and the Agenda?). The fall 2015 Unified Agenda publication appearing in the Federal Register consists of The Regulatory Plan and agency regulatory flexibility agendas, in accordance with the publication requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Agency regulatory flexibility agendas contain only those Agenda entries for rules that are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and entries that have been selected for periodic review under section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

2014-25937,"In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, we are proposing to modify an existing SOR titled, ``Chronic Condition Data Repository (CCDR), System No. 09-70-0573'' last published at 71 FR 54495, September 15, 2006. The current name of the SOR, Chronic Condition Data Repository, was developed during the planning and development stages of the system. Upon the implementation and throughout the operations and maintenance stages of the system, the system has been referred to as the Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW) in common usage and written references. In keeping with this current usage, we will modify the name of this SOR to read, and from this point forward will refer to the system as: ``Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW).'' We propose to broaden the scope of the system to include data that can be easily linked, at the individual patient level, to all Medicare and Medicaid claims, enrollment and/or eligibility data, nursing home and home health assessments, and CMS beneficiary survey data. Accordingly, we are updating the Authority Section to include Title XVIII of the Social Security Act as amended (the Act); Section 1902(a)(6) of the Act; Section 1142(c)(6) of the Act; and Title IV of the Balanced Budget Act (Pub. L. 105-33). The Record Source Categories section will be modified to include data from two new systems of records: the CMS Encounter Data System, System No. 09-70-0506, and the National Death Index, System No. 09-20-0166. These modifications will make the CCW a more useful tool by which to support research, policy analysis, quality improvement activities, and demonstrations that attempt to foster a better understanding of how to improve the quality of life and contain the health care costs of the chronically ill. We propose to modify existing Routine Use Number 1, to limit disclosures only to contractors of CMS. We also propose to add two new routine uses. Specifically, we propose adding a routine use to permit disclosures to healthcare providers who seek patient information for use in care coordination and quality improvement activities as described at 45 CFR 164.506(c)(4). This routine use will be added as Routine Use Number 4. We also propose adding a routine use to support public or private Qualified Entities (QEs) that use Medicare claims data to evaluate the performance of providers of services and suppliers on measures of quality, efficiency, effectiveness, and resource use. This routine use will be added as routine use number 6. Finally, we are modifying the language in Routine Use Number 3 to include grantees of CMS administered grant programs and have made minor grammatical changes to Routine Use Number 10. These modifications will provide a better explanation as to the need for the routine use, and to clearly state CMS's intention when making disclosures of individually identifiable information contained in this system. We have provided background information about the modified system in the Supplementary Information section below.

2013-29724,"This document announces U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP's) plan to conduct a National Customs Automation Program (NCAP) test concerning transmission of electronic filings of certain Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) import data to CBP for commodities regulated by these agencies. The test will involve using the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) Partner Government Agency (PGA) Message Set and the Automated Broker Interface (ABI) to transmit the data. PGA Message Set data may be submitted only for certain entries filed at certain ports. This test is in furtherance of key CBP International Trade Data System (ITDS) initiatives as provided in the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act (SAFE) of 2006 to achieve the vision of ACE as the ``single window'' for the Government and trade community by automating and enhancing the interaction between international trade partners, CBP, and PGAs by facilitating electronic collection, processing, sharing, and review of trade data and documents required by Federal agencies during the cargo import and export process. The initiatives will significantly increase efficiency and reduce costs over the manual, paper-based interactions that have been in place. The PGA Message Set will improve communication between agencies and filers regarding imports and when applicable, will allow test participants to submit the required data once rather than submitting data separately to each agency, resulting in quicker processing. During this test, participants will collaborate with CBP, EPA, and FSIS to examine the effectiveness of the ``single window'' capability. This notice invites public comment concerning the test program, provides legal authority for the test, explains the purpose of the test and the test participant responsibilities, identifies the regulation that will be waived under the test, provides the eligibility and selection criteria for participation in the test, provides a link to a list of ports that are accepting PGA Message Set data under this test, explains the application process, and determines the duration of the test.
