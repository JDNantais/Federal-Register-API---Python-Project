These changes are applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014, unless otherwise specified in this final rule. We also are updating the rate- of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The updated rate-of-increase limits are effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2014. We also are updating the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and implementing certain statutory changes to the LTCH PPS under the Affordable Care Act and the Pathway for Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) Reform Act of 2013 and the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014. In addition, we discuss our proposals on the interruption of stay policy for LTCHs and on retiring the ``5 percent'' payment adjustment for co-located LTCHs. While many of the statutory mandates of the Pathway for SGR Reform Act apply to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014, others will not begin to apply until 2016 and beyond.

2013-28198,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announces the launch of the Predict the Influenza Season Challenge. Each year annual epidemics of influenza occur in the United States. However, variations in the timing and intensity of the season occur each year. Early insights into the timing of the beginning, the peak, and the intensity of the influenza season would be very useful in planning vaccination campaigns, targeting resources and therefore reducing costs associated with influenza prevention and control, and communicating prevention messages to the public. Mathematical and statistical models can be useful in predicting the timing and impact of the influenza season, but no models published to date have successfully predicted key influenza season milestones with sufficient accuracy. The Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDC would like to invest in innovation through the research and development of mathematical and statistical models that use digital surveillance data (e.g. Twitter, internet search data, web surveys, etc.) to predict the timing, peak, and intensity of the upcoming influenza season. By hosting this challenge, the Influenza Division is able to garner the technical innovation required to accurately forecast the influenza season for less resources than would be required through more traditional mechanisms. Furthermore, this challenge will allow the Influenza Division to foster competition and receive and evaluate multiple influenza season forecasts from a number of scientists using a variety of different methodologies, which would not be possible if a single entity were funded. Accurate influenza forecasts have the potential to reduce long-term costs by more efficiently utilizing resources that are available to track influenza and implement control measures during the influenza season. The challenge could be solved by applying any mathematical, statistical, or other approach to predictive modeling. This challenge will provide the Influenza Division with methods that advance the science of prediction modeling, enhance the understanding of influenza modeling and the use of digital data for influenza surveillance, and improve the implementation of prevention and control measures for seasonal influenza. The historical national surveillance data that could be used to enable training and correlation model development by competitors are available at http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html and are updated every Friday at noon. The competitors' predictions and methodology describing their models will comprise their initial challenge entry. Eight subsequent bi-weekly submissions of predictions based on the submitted methodology are also required. Predictions must be national in scope but may also include HHS region predictions; all predictions must be scaled to ILINet. Competitors' models will be evaluated based on the methodology and how well the predictions match the 2013-14 influenza season as measured by the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet: http:// www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm#Outpatient). The competition will award a $75,000 prize and singular recognition to the person or team that most closely predicts the influenza season.",Notice.,"[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES', 'name': 'Health and Human Services Department', 'id': 221, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/health-and-human-services-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/221.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'health-and-human-services-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'name': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'id': 44, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/44.json', 'parent_id': 221, 'slug': 'centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention'}]","['Health and Human Services Department', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention']",,2013-11-25,,,Announcement of Requirements and Registration for the Predict the Influenza Season Challenge,[],Notice,Data Mining

05-19910,"This interim final rule sets forth the State requirements to provide information to us for purposes of estimating improper payments in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), as required under the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002. The IPIA requires heads of Federal agencies to annually estimate and report to the Congress these estimates of improper payments for the programs they oversee and, submit a report on actions the agency is taking to reduce erroneous payments. We published a proposed rule on August 27, 2004 to propose that States measure improper payments in Medicaid and SCHIP and report the State-specific error rates to us for purposes of computing the improper payment estimates for these programs. After extensive analysis of the issues related to having States measure improper payments in Medicaid and SCHIP, including public comments on the provisions in the proposed rule, we are revising our proposed approach. Our new approach incorporates commenters' suggestions to engage a Federal contractor by contracting with that entity to complete the data processing and medical reviews and calculate the State-specific error rates. Based on the States' error rates, the contractor also will calculate the improper payment estimates for these programs which will be reported by the Department of Health and Human Services as required by the IPIA. This interim final rule sets out the types of information that States would need to submit to allow CMS to conduct medical and data processing reviews on claims made in the fee-for-service (FFS) setting. CMS will address estimating improper payments for Medicaid managed care and eligibility and SCHIP FFS, managed care and eligibility at a later time. This rule responds to the public comments on the proposed rule, sets forth the requirements for States to assist us and the contractor to produce State-specific error rates in Medicaid and SCHIP which will be used as the basis for a national error rate, and outlines future plans for measuring eligibility, which may include greater State involvement than the level required for the medical and data processing reviews.",Interim final rule with comment period.,"[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES', 'name': 'Health and Human Services Department', 'id': 221, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/health-and-human-services-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/221.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'health-and-human-services-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services', 'name': 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services', 'id': 45, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/centers-for-medicare-medicaid-services', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/45.json', 'parent_id': 221, 'slug': 'centers-for-medicare-medicaid-services'}]","['Health and Human Services Department', 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services']",,2005-10-05,False,,Medicaid Program and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Payment Error Rate Measurement,"['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Grant programs-health', 'Health facilities', 'Health insurance', 'Medicaid', 'Privacy', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements']",Rule,Data Mining

03-18976,"The OCC, Board, FDIC, and OTS (the Agencies) are publishing for industry comment two documents that set forth draft supervisory guidance for implementing proposed revisions to the risk-based capital standards in the United States. These proposed revisions, which would implement the New Basel Capital Accord in the United States, are published as an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) elsewhere in today's Federal Register. Under the advanced approaches for credit and operational risk described in the ANPR, banking organizations would use internal estimates of certain risk components as key inputs in the determination of their regulatory capital requirements. The Agencies believe that supervisory guidance is necessary to balance the flexibility inherent in the advanced approaches with high standards that promote safety and soundness and encourage comparability across institutions. The first document sets forth Draft Supervisory Guidance on Internal Ratings-Based Systems for Corporate Credit (corporate IRB guidance). This document describes supervisory expectations for institutions that intend to adopt the advanced internal ratings-based approach (A-IRB) for credit risk as set forth in today's ANPR. The corporate IRB guidance is intended to provide supervisors and institutions with a clear description of the essential components and characteristics of an acceptable A-IRB framework. The guidance focuses specifically on corporate credit portfolios; further guidance is expected at a later date on other credit portfolios (including, for example, retail and commercial real estate portfolios). The second document sets forth Draft Supervisory Guidance on Operational Risk Advanced Measurement Approaches for Operational Risk (AMA guidance). This document outlines supervisory expectations for institutions that intend to adopt an advanced measurement approach (AMA) for operational risk as set forth in today's ANPR. The Agencies are seeking comments on the supervisory standards set forth in both documents. In addition to seeking comment on specific aspects of the supervisory guidance set forth in the documents, the Agencies are seeking comment on the extent to which the supervisory guidance strikes the appropriate balance between flexibility and specificity.

99-9757,"The National Cancer Institute seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with a software company with demonstrated excellence in the development and deployment of software applications for the enterprise and individuals. NCI has recently developed a powerful but user-friendly computer-based system which enables its users to create, use and share a knowledge base of information consisting of diverse objects related to each other by semantically meaningful links. This system, provisionally called ``KBTool'', can be considered a new class of software application since it is sufficiently different from existing applications. The system provides a knowledge base that is seamless, allowing individuals to store information on a virtually unlimited range of objects and concepts. In addition, dense and informative links between many types of concepts are constructed. The system is extensible so that it is suited for use in distributed systems in which information is shared between users and stored at different physical locations. Because of the power of the system and its relevance to many domains of knowledge and types of applications, the NCI is seeking a commercial partner for its continued development and deployment. The software was originally created to organize and link vast quantities of scientific data; however, NCI predicts that KBTool's functionality will be applicable to a wide variety of fields.
