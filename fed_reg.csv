2019-14902,"This proposed rule proposes to implement two new mandatory Medicare payment models under section 1115A of the Social Security Act--the Radiation Oncology Model (RO Model) and the End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Treatment Choices Model (ETC Model).

The proposed ETC Model would be a mandatory payment model focused on encouraging greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants, in order to preserve or enhance the quality of care furnished to Medicare beneficiaries while reducing Medicare expenditures. The ETC Model would include ESRD facilities and certain clinicians caring for beneficiaries with ESRD-- or Managing Clinicians--located in selected geographic areas as participants. CMS would assess the performance of participating Managing Clinicians and ESRD facilities on their rates of home dialysis and kidney and kidney-pancreas transplants during each Measurement Year (MY), and would subsequently adjust certain of their Medicare payments upward or downward during the corresponding performance payment adjustment period based on their home dialysis rate and transplant rate. CMS would also positively adjust certain Medicare payments to participating ESRD facilities and Managing Clinicians for home dialysis and home dialysis-related claims in the initial 3 years of the ETC Model.

The proposed rules also include a modernized approach to securities registration fee payment that would require closed-end investment companies that operate as ``interval funds'' to pay securities registration fees using the same method that mutual funds use today.

The vehicle for which Nuro requests an exemption is a low-speed, highly automated delivery vehicle intended to be operated without any human occupants and thus designed without any seating. Specifically, Nuro requests exemptions from the requirements in FMVSS No. 500 that its vehicle be equipped with rearview mirrors, a windshield that complies with FMVSS No. 205, and a rear visibility (backup camera) system that complies with FMVSS No. 111. Nuro states that the absence of human occupants, combined with the vehicle's various safety design features, including the vehicle's Automated Driving System (ADS), make compliance with these provisions of FMVSS No. 500 either unnecessary for, or detrimental to, the safety of pedestrians and cyclists.

In addition, the Commission is proposing an interpretation to address the application of the portfolio reconciliation, portfolio compression, and trading relationship documentation requirements to cross-border security-based swap activities and is proposing to amend Rule 3a71-6 to address the potential availability of substituted compliance in connection with those requirements. Moreover, the proposed rules would make corresponding changes to the recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements applicable to SBS Entities. Finally, the Commission is requesting comment on how certain aspects of the proposed rules address how a security-based swap data repository (``SDR'') could potentially satisfy its obligation to verify the terms of each security-based swap with both counterparties to the transaction.",Proposed rule.,"[{'raw_name': 'SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION', 'name': 'Securities and Exchange Commission', 'id': 466, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/securities-and-exchange-commission', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/466.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'securities-and-exchange-commission'}]",['Securities and Exchange Commission'],,2019-02-15,False,,Risk Mitigation Techniques for Uncleared Security-Based Swaps,"['Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Securities']",Proposed Rule

2018-21919,"NHTSA is seeking public comment on matters related to the near-term and long-term challenges of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) testing, development and eventual deployment. ADS testing and development are already underway in several areas of the United States. As technology evolves and in anticipation of requests to test and further develop high and full ADS, including those in vehicles without traditional controls necessary for a human driver, NHTSA is issuing this ANPRM to obtain public comments on the factors and structure that are appropriate for the Agency to consider in designing a national pilot program that will enable it to facilitate, monitor and learn from the testing and development of the emerging advanced vehicle safety technologies and to assure the safety of those activities. The Agency seeks these comments from interested stakeholders, including State and local authorities, companies, researchers, safety advocates and other experts interested in, engaged in or planning to become engaged in the design, development, testing, and deployment of motor vehicles with high and full driving automation. The Agency also seeks comments from road users, including vehicle drivers and passengers, cyclists and pedestrians. More specifically, NHTSA requests comments on the following topics related to ADS safety research. First, NHTSA seeks comments on potential factors that should be considered in designing a pilot program for the safe on-road testing and deployment of vehicles with high and full driving automation and associated equipment. Second, the Agency seeks comments on the use of existing statutory provisions and regulations to allow for the implementation of such a pilot program. Third, the Agency seeks comment on any additional elements of regulatory relief (e.g., exceptions, exemptions, or other potential measures) that might be needed to facilitate the efforts to participate in the pilot program and conduct on-road research and testing involving these vehicles, especially those that lack controls for human drivers and thus may not comply with all existing safety standards. Fourth, with respect to the granting of exemptions to enable companies to participate in such a program, the Agency seeks comments on the nature of the safety and any other analyses that it should perform in assessing the merits of individual exemption petitions and on the types of terms and conditions it should consider attaching to exemptions to protect public safety and facilitate the Agency's monitoring and learning from the testing and deployment, while preserving the freedom to innovate. By developing a robust record of the answers to these important questions, NHTSA expects to learn more about the progress of ADS and the ways in which the Agency can facilitate safe and efficient ADS testing and deployment for the benefit of individual consumers and the traveling public as a whole.",Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM).,"[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION', 'name': 'Transportation Department', 'id': 492, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/transportation-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/492.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'transportation-department'}, {'raw_name': 'National Highway Traffic Safety Administration', 'name': 'National Highway Traffic Safety Administration', 'id': 345, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-highway-traffic-safety-administration', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/345.json', 'parent_id': 492, 'slug': 'national-highway-traffic-safety-administration'}]","['Transportation Department', 'National Highway Traffic Safety Administration']",,2018-10-10,False,,Pilot Program for Collaborative Research on Motor Vehicles With High or Full Driving Automation,[],Proposed Rule

Pursuant to those provisions, 16- and 17-year-old employees generally cannot work in a nonagricultural occupation governed by any of the Department's Hazardous Occupations Orders (HOs). HO 7 prohibits youth from working in occupations involving the operation of a power-driven patient lift. Patient lifts, however, substantially differ in form and function from the other equipment that the HO governs, including forklifts, backhoes, cranes, and other heavy industrial equipment. Additionally, patient lifts are safer for workers than the alternative method of manually lifting patients. In response to significant public input and bipartisan, bicameral requests from Members of Congress, the Department proposes to remove the operation of power-driven patient lifts from the list of activities that HO 7 prohibits.

The SAFE Vehicles Rule, if finalized, would amend certain existing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks and establish new standards, all covering model years 2021 through 2026. More specifically, NHTSA is proposing new CAFE standards for model years 2022 through 2026 and amending its 2021 model year CAFE standards because they are no longer maximum feasible standards, and EPA is proposing to amend its carbon dioxide emissions standards for model years 2021 through 2025 because they are no longer appropriate and reasonable in addition to establishing new standards for model year 2026. The preferred alternative is to retain the model year 2020 standards (specifically, the footprint target curves for passenger cars and light trucks) for both programs through model year 2026, but comment is sought on a range of alternatives discussed throughout this document.

TFTEA allows a transition period wherein drawback claimants will have the choice between filing claims under the existing process detailed in the current regulations or filing claims under the proposed new process. This document explains how filings during the transition period will work, discusses the interim policy guidance procedures for filing claims prior to these regulations becoming final, and proposes to make TFTEA-related changes, dealing with bonds, regarding joint and several liability for the importer of the goods and the drawback claimant, and technical corrections and conforming changes to CBP regulations.

2018-05345,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to obtain information for consideration in developing a tobacco product standard to set the maximum nicotine level for cigarettes. Because tobacco-related harms ultimately result from addiction to the nicotine in such products, causing repeated use and exposure to toxicants, FDA is considering taking this action to reduce the level of nicotine in these products so they are minimally addictive or nonaddictive, using the best available science to determine a level that is appropriate for the protection of the public health. FDA is using the term ``nonaddictive'' in this document specifically in the context of a potentially nonaddictive cigarette. We acknowledge the highly addictive potential of nicotine itself depending upon the route of delivery. As discussed elsewhere in this document, questions remain with respect to the precise level of nicotine in cigarettes that might render them either minimally addictive or nonaddictive for specific members or segments of the population. We envision the potential circumstance where nicotine levels in cigarettes do not spur or sustain addiction for some portion of potential smokers. This could give addicted users the choice and ability to quit more easily, and it could help to prevent experimenters (mainly youth) from initiating regular use and becoming regular smokers.

The rule exempts certain loans from the underwriting criteria prescribed in the rule if they have specific consumer protections. Second, for the same set of loans along with certain other high-cost longer-term loans, the rule identifies it as an unfair and abusive practice to make attempts to withdraw payment from consumers' accounts after two consecutive payment attempts have failed, unless the consumer provides a new and specific authorization to do so. Finally, the rule prescribes notices to consumers before attempting to withdraw payments from their account, as well as processes and criteria for registration of information systems, for requirements to furnish and obtain information from them, and for compliance programs and record retention.

Therefore, we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), hereby revise the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife, under the authority of the Act, by establishing a DPS and removing the GYE grizzly bear DPS. The Service has determined that the GYE grizzly bear population has increased in size and more than tripled its occupied range since being listed as threatened under the Act in 1975 and that threats to the population are sufficiently minimized. The participating States of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming and Federal agencies have adopted the necessary post-delisting plans and regulations, which adequately ensure that the GYE population of grizzly bears remains recovered. Concurrent to this final rule, we are appending the Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan Supplement: Revised Demographic Criteria to the 1993 Recovery Plan. Moreover, prior to publication of this final rule, the Yellowstone Ecosystem Subcommittee finalized the 2016 Conservation Strategy that will guide post-delisting monitoring and management of the grizzly bear in the GYE. Additionally, the U.S. Forest Service finalized in 2006 the Forest Plan Amendment for Grizzly Bear Conservation for the GYE National Forests and made a decision to incorporate this Amendment into the affected National Forests' Land Management Plans. Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park appended the habitat standards to their Park Superintendent's Compendia, thereby ensuring that these national parks would manage habitat in accordance with the habitat standards.

In 2015, there were an estimated 33,400 table saw, emergency department-treated injuries. Of these, CPSC staff estimates that 30,800 (92 percent) are likely related to the victim making contact with the saw blade. CPSC staff's review of the existing data indicates that currently available safety devices, such as the modular blade guard and riving knife, do not adequately address the unreasonable risk of blade-contact injuries on table saws. To address this risk, the Commission proposes a rule that is based, in part, on work conducted by Underwriters Laboratories Inc. The proposed rule would establish a performance standard that requires table saws, when powered on, to limit the depth of cut to 3.5 millimeters when a test probe, acting as surrogate for a human body/finger, contacts the spinning blade at a radial approach rate of 1 meter per second (m/s). The proposed rule would address an estimated 54,800 medically treated blade-contact injuries annually.

2016-30410,"OSHA is amending its recordkeeping regulations to clarify that the duty to make and maintain accurate records of work-related injuries and illnesses is an ongoing obligation. The duty to record an injury or illness continues for as long as the employer must keep records of the recordable injury or illness; the duty does not expire just because the employer fails to create the necessary records when first required to do so. The amendments consist of revisions to the titles of some existing sections and subparts and changes to the text of some existing provisions. The amendments add no new compliance obligations and do not require employers to make records of any injuries or illnesses for which records are not currently required to be made. The amendments in this rule are adopted in response to a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In that case, a majority held that the Occupational Safety and Health Act does not permit OSHA to impose a continuing recordkeeping obligation on employers. One judge filed a concurring opinion disagreeing with this reading of the statute, but finding that the text of OSHA's recordkeeping regulations did not impose continuing recordkeeping duties. OSHA disagrees with the majority's reading of the law, but agrees that its recordkeeping regulations were not clear with respect to the continuing nature of employers' recordkeeping obligations. This final rule is designed to clarify the regulations in advance of possible future federal court litigation that could further develop the law on the statutory issues addressed in the D.C. Circuit's decision.",Final rule.,"[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF LABOR', 'name': 'Labor Department', 'id': 271, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/labor-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/271.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'labor-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Occupational Safety and Health Administration', 'name': 'Occupational Safety and Health Administration', 'id': 386, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/occupational-safety-and-health-administration', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/386.json', 'parent_id': 271, 'slug': 'occupational-safety-and-health-administration'}]","['Labor Department', 'Occupational Safety and Health Administration']",2017-01-18,2016-12-19,False,,Clarification of Employer's Continuing Obligation To Make and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury and Illness,"['Health statistics', 'Occupational safety and health', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Safety']",Rule

2016-30437,"In March 2016, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and ASTM International announced a new international standard that can ``map'' the critically important environmental aspects of manufacturing processes, leading to significant improvements in sustainability while keeping a product's life cycle low cost and efficient. Sustainability for manufacturing is beginning to be addressed through the recently approved ASTM Standard Guide for Characterizing Environmental Aspects of Manufacturing Processes (ASTM E60.13 E3012-16). The standard provides a science-based, systematic approach to capture and describe information about the environmental aspects for any manufacturing production process or group of processes, and then use that data to make informed decisions on improvements. NIST is announcing the Reusable Abstractions of Manufacturing Processes (RAMP) Challenge, with support from ASTM International, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC) Organizing Committee, to familiarize the community with a recent standard for modeling manufacturing processes that was developed under the ASTM's E60.13 Subcommittee on Sustainable Manufacturing. The RAMP Challenge calls on participants (either as an individual or as a team) to model any manufacturing process and demonstrate application of the ASTM E3012-16 Unit Manufacturing Process (UMP) representation for purposes of information sharing and sustainability assessment. The RAMP Challenge will provide an opportunity for participants to put this standard into practice in modeling a process of their own interest, and to share experiences in applying the standard across a variety of processes. Formal methods for acquiring and exchanging information about manufacturing processes will lead to consistent characterizations and help establish a collection for reuse of these models. Standard methods will ensure effective communication of computational analytics and sharing of sustainability performance data. Results of the competition will assist in demonstrating the use of a reusable standard format leading to models suitable for automated inclusion in a system analysis, such as a system simulation model or an optimization program.",Notice.,"[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE', 'name': 'Commerce Department', 'id': 54, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/commerce-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/54.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'commerce-department'}, {'raw_name': 'National Institute of Standards and Technology', 'name': 'National Institute of Standards and Technology', 'id': 352, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-institute-of-standards-and-technology', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/352.json', 'parent_id': 54, 'slug': 'national-institute-of-standards-and-technology'}]","['Commerce Department', 'National Institute of Standards and Technology']",,2016-12-19,,,Announcement of Requirements and Registration for National Institute of Standards and Technology Prize Competition-Reusable Abstractions of Manufacturing Processes (RAMP) Challenge,[],Notice

While these protections extend to most workers, the FLSA does provide a number of exemptions. In this Final Rule, the Department of Labor (Department) revises final regulations under the FLSA implementing the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay for executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and computer employees. These exemptions are frequently referred to as the ``EAP'' or ``white collar'' exemptions. To be considered exempt under part 541, employees must meet certain minimum requirements related to their primary job duties and, in most instances, must be paid on a salary basis at not less than the minimum amounts specified in the regulations. In this Final Rule the Department updates the standard salary level and total annual compensation requirements to more effectively distinguish between overtime-eligible white collar employees and those who may be exempt, thereby making the exemption easier for employers and employees to understand and ensuring that the FLSA's intended overtime protections are fully implemented. The Department sets the standard salary level for exempt EAP employees at the 40th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census Region. The Department also permits employers to satisfy up to 10 percent of the standard salary requirement with nondiscretionary bonuses, incentive payments, and commissions, provided these forms of compensation are paid at least quarterly. The Department sets the total annual compensation requirement for an exempt Highly Compensated Employee (HCE) equal to the annualized weekly earnings of the 90th percentile of full-time salaried workers nationally. The Department also adds a provision to the regulations that automatically updates the standard salary level and HCE compensation requirements every three years by maintaining the earnings percentiles set in this Final Rule to prevent these thresholds from becoming outdated.

2015-32666,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is proposing to amend its regulations related to certain employment-based immigrant and nonimmigrant visa programs. The proposed amendments would provide various benefits to participants in those programs, including: Improved processes for U.S. employers seeking to sponsor and retain immigrant and nonimmigrant workers, greater stability and job flexibility for such workers, and increased transparency and consistency in the application of agency policy related to affected classifications. Many of these changes are primarily aimed at improving the ability of U.S. employers to hire and retain high-skilled workers who are beneficiaries of approved employment-based immigrant visa petitions and are waiting to become lawful permanent residents (LPRs), while increasing the ability of such workers to seek promotions, accept lateral positions with current employers, change employers, or pursue other employment options. First, DHS proposes to amend its regulations consistent with certain worker portability and other provisions in the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 (AC21), as amended, as well as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (ACWIA). These proposed amendments would clarify and improve longstanding agency policies and procedures-- previously articulated in agency memoranda and precedent decisions-- implementing sections of AC21 and ACWIA related to certain foreign workers, including sections specific to workers who have been sponsored for LPR status by their employers. In so doing, the proposed rule would enhance consistency among agency adjudicators and provide a primary repository of governing rules for the regulated community. In addition, the proposed rule would clarify several interpretive questions raised by AC21 and ACWIA. Second, consistent with existing DHS authorities and the goals of AC21 and ACWIA, DHS proposes to amend its regulations governing certain employment-based immigrant and nonimmigrant visa programs to provide additional stability and flexibility to employers and workers in those programs. The proposed rule would, among other things: improve job portability for certain beneficiaries of approved employment-based immigrant visa petitions by limiting the grounds for automatic revocation of petition approval; further enhance job portability for such beneficiaries by increasing their ability to retain their priority dates for use with subsequently approved employment-based immigrant visa petitions; establish or extend grace periods for certain high- skilled nonimmigrant workers so that they may more easily maintain their nonimmigrant status when changing employment opportunities; and provide additional stability and flexibility to certain high-skilled workers by allowing those who are working in the United States in certain nonimmigrant statuses, are the beneficiaries of approved employment-based immigrant visa petitions, are subject to immigrant visa backlogs, and demonstrate compelling circumstances to independently apply for employment authorization for a limited period. These and other proposed changes would provide much needed flexibility to the beneficiaries of employment-based immigrant visa petitions, as well as the U.S. employers who employ and sponsor them for permanent residence. Finally, to provide additional certainty and stability to certain employment-authorized individuals and their U.S. employers, DHS is also proposing changes to its regulations governing the processing of applications for employment authorization to minimize the risk of any gaps in such authorization. These changes would provide for the automatic extension of the validity of certain Employment Authorization Documents (EADs or Forms I-766) for an interim period upon the timely filing of an application to renew such documents. At the same time, in light of national security and fraud concerns, DHS is proposing to remove regulations that provide a 90-day processing timeline for EAD applications and that require the issuance of interim EADs if processing extends beyond the 90-day mark.",Proposed rule.,"[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY', 'name': 'Homeland Security Department', 'id': 227, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/homeland-security-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/227.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'homeland-security-department'}]",['Homeland Security Department'],,2015-12-31,False,,"Retention of EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 Immigrant Workers and Program Improvements Affecting High-Skilled Nonimmigrant Workers","['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Adoption and foster care', 'Aliens', 'Cultural exchange programs', 'Employment', 'Foreign officials', 'Health professions', 'Immigration', 'Penalties', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Students']",Proposed Rule

2015-21023,"This action proposes to amend the new source performance standards (NSPS) for the oil and natural gas source category by setting standards for both methane and volatile organic compounds (VOC) for certain equipment, processes and activities across this source category. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is including requirements for methane emissions in this proposal because methane is a greenhouse gas (GHG), and the oil and natural gas category is currently one of the country's largest emitters of methane. In 2009, the EPA found that by causing or contributing to climate change, GHGs endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations. The EPA is proposing both methane and VOC standards for several emission sources not currently covered by the NSPS and proposing methane standards for certain emission sources that are currently regulated for VOC. The proposed amendents also extend the current VOC standards to the remaining unregulated equipment across the source category and additionally establish methane standards for this equipment. Lastly, amendments to improve implementation of the current NSPS are being proposed which result from reconsideration of certain issues raised in petitions for reconsideration that were received by the Administrator on the August 16, 2012, final NSPS for the oil and natural gas sector and related amendments. Except for the implementation improvements and the setting of standards for methane, these amendments do not change the requirements for operations already covered by the current standards.",Proposed rule.,"[{'raw_name': 'ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY', 'name': 'Environmental Protection Agency', 'id': 145, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/environmental-protection-agency', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/145.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'environmental-protection-agency'}]",['Environmental Protection Agency'],,2015-09-18,True,,Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New and Modified Sources,"['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Air pollution control', 'Intergovernmental relations', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements']",Proposed Rule

2015-15500,"EPA and NHTSA, on behalf of the Department of Transportation, are each proposing rules to establish a comprehensive Phase 2 Heavy- Duty (HD) National Program that will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel consumption for new on-road heavy-duty vehicles. This technology-advancing program would phase in over the long-term, beginning in the 2018 model year and culminating in standards for model year 2027, responding to the President's directive on February 18, 2014, to develop new standards that will take us well into the next decade. NHTSA's proposed fuel consumption standards and EPA's proposed carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>) emission standards are tailored to each of four regulatory categories of heavy-duty vehicles: Combination tractors; trailers used in combination with those tractors; heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans; and vocational vehicles. The proposal also includes separate standards for the engines that power combination tractors and vocational vehicles. Certain proposed requirements for control of GHG emissions are exclusive to EPA programs. These include EPA's proposed hydrofluorocarbon standards to control leakage from air conditioning systems in vocational vehicles, and EPA's proposed nitrous oxide (N<INF>2</INF>O) and methane (CH<INF>4</INF>) standards for heavy-duty engines. Additionally, NHTSA is addressing misalignment in the Phase 1 standards between EPA and NHTSA to ensure there are no differences in compliance standards between the agencies. In an effort to promote efficiency, the agencies are also proposing to amend their rules to modify reporting requirements, such as the method by which manufacturers submit pre-model, mid-model, and supplemental reports. EPA's proposed HD Phase 2 GHG emission standards are authorized under the Clean Air Act and NHTSA's proposed HD Phase 2 fuel consumption standards authorized under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. These standards would begin with model year 2018 for trailers under EPA standards and 2021 for all of the other heavy-duty vehicle and engine categories. The agencies estimate that the combined standards would reduce CO<INF>2</INF> emissions by approximately 1 billion metric tons and save 1.8 billion barrels of oil over the life of vehicles and engines sold during the Phase 2 program, providing over $200 billion in net societal benefits. As noted, the proposal also includes certain EPA-specific provisions relating to control of emissions of pollutants other than GHGs. EPA is seeking comment on non- GHG emission standards relating to the use of auxiliary power units installed in tractors.

2015-15464,"The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA or Act) guarantees a minimum wage and overtime pay at a rate of not less than one and one- half times the employee's regular rate for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. While these protections extend to most workers, the FLSA does provide a number of exemptions. The Department of Labor (Department) proposes to update and revise the regulations issued under the FLSA implementing the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay for executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and computer employees. This exemption is referred to as the FLSA's ``EAP'' or ``white collar'' exemption. To be considered exempt, employees must meet certain minimum tests related to their primary job duties and be paid on a salary basis at not less than a specified minimum amount. The standard salary level required for exemption is currently $455 a week ($23,660 for a full-year worker) and was last updated in 2004. By way of this rulemaking, the Department seeks to update the salary level to ensure that the FLSA's intended overtime protections are fully implemented, and to simplify the identification of nonexempt employees, thus making the EAP exemption easier for employers and workers to understand. The Department also proposes automatically updating the salary level to prevent the level from becoming outdated with the often lengthy passage of time between rulemakings. Lastly, the Department is considering whether revisions to the duties tests are necessary in order to ensure that these tests fully reflect the purpose of the exemption.",Proposed rule and request for comments.,"[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF LABOR', 'name': 'Labor Department', 'id': 271, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/labor-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/271.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'labor-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Wage and Hour Division', 'name': 'Wage and Hour Division', 'id': 524, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/wage-and-hour-division', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/524.json', 'parent_id': 271, 'slug': 'wage-and-hour-division'}]","['Labor Department', 'Wage and Hour Division']",,2015-07-06,True,,"Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Outside Sales and Computer Employees","['Labor', 'Minimum wages', 'Teachers', 'Wages', 'Wages']",Proposed Rule

Labor Compliance Advisors will be available to consult with contractors that report these types of violations and will coordinate assistance with the relevant enforcement agencies. Contractors will require their subcontractors to report these types of violations of the identified labor laws and will similarly assess reported violations.\2\ And to achieve further paycheck transparency for workers, contractors and subcontractors will be required to provide their workers on federal contracts with information each pay period regarding how their pay is calculated (a wage statement) and provide notice to those workers whom they treat as independent contractors. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------",Proposed guidance.,"[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF LABOR', 'name': 'Labor Department', 'id': 271, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/labor-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/271.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'labor-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Office of the Secretary'}]","['Labor Department', 'Office of the Secretary']",,2015-05-28,,,"Guidance for Executive Order 13673, “Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces”",[],Notice

This joint proposed rule provides guidance for State and local workforce development systems that increase the skill and credential attainment, employment, retention, and earnings of participants, especially those with significant barriers to employment, thereby improving the quality of the workforce, reducing welfare dependency, and enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of the nation. WIOA strengthened the alignment of the workforce development system's six core programs by imposing unified strategic planning requirements, common performance accountability measures, and requirements governing the one-stop delivery system. In so doing, WIOA placed heightened emphasis on coordination and collaboration at the Federal, State, and local levels to ensure a streamlined and coordinated service delivery system for job seekers, including those with disabilities, and employers. To that end, the Departments of Education and Labor propose to issue this joint NPRM to implement jointly-administered activities under title I of WIOA. These regulations lay the foundation, through coordination and collaboration at the Federal level, for implementing the vision and goals of WIOA. In addition to this joint NPRM, the Departments have proposed separate NPRMs to implement program-specific requirements of WIOA that fall under each Department's purview. The Department of Labor is proposing a NPRM governing program-specific requirements under titles I and III of WIOA. The Department of Education is proposing three NPRMs: one implementing program-specific requirements of the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA), as reauthorized by title II of WIOA; and two NPRMs implementing all program-specific requirements for all programs authorized under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by title IV of WIOA. The Department-specific NPRMs have been simultaneously published in this issue of the Federal Register. Developing and issuing all five WIOA NPRMs in a coordinated manner reinforces WIOA's heightened emphasis on collaboration to ensure an integrated and seamless service delivery system for job seekers and employers.",Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).,"[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF LABOR', 'name': 'Labor Department', 'id': 271, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/labor-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/271.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'labor-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Employment and Training Administration', 'name': 'Employment and Training Administration', 'id': 133, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/employment-and-training-administration', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/133.json', 'parent_id': 271, 'slug': 'employment-and-training-administration'}, {'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION', 'name': 'Education Department', 'id': 126, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/education-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/126.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'education-department'}]","['Labor Department', 'Employment and Training Administration', 'Education Department']",,2015-04-16,True,,"Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act; Joint Rule for Unified and Combined State Plans, Performance Accountability, and the One-Stop System Joint Provisions; Notice of Proposed Rulemaking","['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Adult education', 'Employment', 'Grant programs-education', 'Grant programs-labor', 'Grant programs-social programs', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Vocational rehabilitation']",Proposed Rule

2015-00947,"The NCUA Board (Board) is seeking comment on a second proposed rule that would amend NCUA's current regulations regarding prompt corrective action (PCA) to require that credit unions taking certain risks hold capital commensurate with those risks. The proposal would restructure NCUA's PCA regulations and make various revisions, including amending the agency's current risk-based net worth requirement by replacing the current risk-based net worth ratio with a new risk-based capital ratio for federally insured natural person credit unions (credit unions). The proposal would also, in response to public comments received, make a number of changes to the original proposed rule that the Board published in the Federal Register on February 27, 2014. These changes include, among other things, exempting credit unions with up to $100 million in total assets from the new rule, lowering the risk-based capital ratio level required for an affected credit union to be classified as well capitalized from 10.5 percent to 10 percent, lowering the risk weights for various classes of assets, removing interest rate risk components from the risk weights, and extending the implementation timeframe to January 1, 2019. These changes would substantially reduce the number of credit unions subject to the rule, reduce the impact on affected credit unions, and afford affected credit unions sufficient time to prepare for the rule's implementation. The proposed risk-based capital requirement set forth in this proposal would be more consistent with NCUA's risk-based capital measure for corporate credit unions and more comparable to the regulatory risk-based capital measures used by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and Office of the Comptroller of Currency (Other Banking Agencies). In addition, the proposed revisions would amend the risk weights for many of NCUA's current asset classifications; require higher minimum levels of capital for credit unions with concentrations of assets in real estate loans or commercial loans or higher levels of non-current loans; and set forth how NCUA can address a credit union that does not hold capital that is commensurate with its risk. The proposed revisions would also eliminate several provisions in NCUA's current PCA regulations, including provisions relating to the regular reserve account, risk-mitigation credits, and alternative risk weights. (For clarity, the ``current'' PCA regulations would remain in force until the effective date of a final risk-based capital rule.)",Proposed rule.,"[{'raw_name': 'NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION', 'name': 'National Credit Union Administration', 'id': 335, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-credit-union-administration', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/335.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'national-credit-union-administration'}]",['National Credit Union Administration'],,2015-01-27,False,,Risk-Based Capital,"['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Bank deposit insurance', 'Bonds', 'Claims', 'Credit', 'Credit unions', 'Crime', 'Equal access to justice', 'Insurance', 'Investigations', 'Investments', 'Lawyers', 'Loan programs-business', 'Penalties', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements']",Proposed Rule

2014-27286,"The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) is proposing to amend Regulation E, which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA); Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA); and the official interpretations to the regulations. The proposal would create comprehensive consumer protections for prepaid financial products. The proposal would expressly bring such products within the ambit of Regulation E as prepaid accounts and create new provisions specific to such accounts. The proposal would generally cover those prepaid accounts that are cards, codes, or other devices capable of being loaded with funds and usable at unaffiliated merchants or for person-to-person transfers, and are not gift cards (or certain other related types of cards). The proposal would modify Regulation E to establish disclosure requirements specific to prepaid accounts that would require financial institutions to provide certain disclosures to consumers prior to and after the acquisition of a prepaid account. The proposal would also include an option for an alternative to Regulation E's periodic statement requirement that would permit prepaid product providers to make available to consumers certain methods for access to account information in lieu of sending periodic statements. Additionally, the proposal would apply Regulation E's limited liability and error resolution provisions to prepaid accounts, with certain modifications, including applying these provisions after account registration. Moreover, the proposal would require prepaid account issuers to provide the Bureau with terms and conditions for prepaid accounts, which it would post on a Web site maintained by the Bureau. Relatedly, issuers would also be required to post the terms and conditions on their own Web sites or make them available upon request. Finally, the proposal would also contain amendments to Regulations Z and E to regulate prepaid accounts with overdraft services or credit features. Among other things, prepaid cards that access overdraft services or credit features for a fee would generally be credit cards subject to Regulation Z and its credit card rules. Moreover, the proposal would require that consumers consent to overdraft services or credit features and give them at least 21 days to repay the debt incurred in connection with using such services or features. Further, Regulation E would be amended to include disclosures about overdraft services or credit features that could be linked to prepaid accounts. The compulsory use provision under Regulation E would also be amended so that prepaid account issuers would be prohibited from requiring consumers to set up preauthorized electronic fund transfers to repay credit extended through an overdraft service or credit feature.",Proposed rule; request for public comment.,"[{'raw_name': 'BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION', 'name': 'Consumer Financial Protection Bureau', 'id': 573, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/consumer-financial-protection-bureau', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/573.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'consumer-financial-protection-bureau'}]",['Consumer Financial Protection Bureau'],,2014-12-23,True,,Prepaid Accounts Under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (Regulation E) and the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z),"['Advertising', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Consumer protection', 'Credit', 'Credit unions', 'Electronic funds transfers', 'Mortgages', 'National banks', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Savings associations', 'Truth in lending']",Proposed Rule

This species is currently listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that delisting the species is not warranted, but rather, a revision to the current listed entity to define a distinct population segment (DPS), consistent with our 1996 distinct population segment policy, is appropriate. As such, we propose to amend the current listing of the southern Selkirk Mountains population of woodland caribou by defining the Southern Mountain Caribou DPS, which includes the currently listed southern Selkirk Mountains population of woodland caribou, and we propose to designate the status of the Southern Mountain Caribou DPS as threatened under the Act. If we finalize this rule as proposed, the Southern Mountain Caribou DPS will be listed as threatened under the Act. This DPS includes the currently listed southern Selkirk Mountains population of woodland caribou, a transboundary population that moves between British Columbia, Canada, and northern Idaho and northeastern Washington, United States. We have determined that the approximately 30,010 acres (12,145 hectares) designated as critical habitat on November 28, 2012 (77 FR 71042), for the southern Selkirk Mountains population of woodland caribou is applicable to the U.S. portion of the proposed Southern Mountain Caribou DPS and, as such, reaffirm the existing critical habitat for the DPS should the proposed amendment to the listed entity become final.",Proposed rule; 12-month petition finding.,"[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR', 'name': 'Interior Department', 'id': 253, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'interior-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'id': 197, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/fish-and-wildlife-service', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/197.json', 'parent_id': 253, 'slug': 'fish-and-wildlife-service'}]","['Interior Department', 'Fish and Wildlife Service']",,2014-05-08,False,,Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; 12-Month Finding on a Petition To Delist the Southern Selkirk Mountains Population of Woodland Caribou and Proposed Rule To Amend the Listing,"['Endangered and threatened species', 'Exports', 'Imports', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Transportation']",Proposed Rule

2014-03959,"This notice of proposed rulemaking introduces the beginning of the Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology's (ONC's) more frequent approach to health information technology certification regulations. Under this approach ONC intends to update certification criteria editions every 12 to 18 months in order to provide smaller, more incremental regulatory changes and policy proposals. This approach gives stakeholders greater and earlier visibility into our regulatory direction before compliance is required, provides more time for public input on policy proposals under consideration for future rulemakings, and enables our certification processes to more quickly adopt newer industry standards that can enhance interoperability. The 2015 Edition EHR certification criteria proposed in this rule would be voluntary. No EHR technology developer who has certified its EHR technology to the 2014 Edition would need to recertify to the 2015 Edition in order for its customers to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs (EHR Incentive Programs). Furthermore, eligible professionals, eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals that participate in the EHR Incentive Programs would not need to ``upgrade'' to EHR technology certified to 2015 Edition in order to have EHR technology that meets the Certified EHR Technology (CEHRT) definition. Instead, the 2015 Edition EHR certification criteria would accomplish three policy objectives: 1) They would enable a more efficient and effective response to stakeholder feedback; 2) they would incorporate ``bug fixes'' to improve on 2014 Edition EHR certification criteria in ways designed to make our rules clearer and easier to implement; and 3) they reference newer standards and implementation specifications that reflect our commitment to promoting innovation and enhancing interoperability. Specific revisions to the ONC HIT Certification Program are also included in this proposed rule. These proposals focus on: Improving regulatory clarity; simplifying the certification of EHR Modules that are designed for purposes other than achieving meaningful use; and discontinuing the use of the Complete EHR definition starting with the 2015 Edition.",Notice of proposed rulemaking with comment period.,"[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES', 'name': 'Health and Human Services Department', 'id': 221, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/health-and-human-services-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/221.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'health-and-human-services-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Office of the Secretary'}]","['Health and Human Services Department', 'Office of the Secretary']",,2014-02-26,True,,Voluntary 2015 Edition Electronic Health Record (EHR) Certification Criteria; Interoperability Updates and Regulatory Improvements,"['Computer technology', 'Health', 'Health care', 'Health insurance', 'Health records', 'Hospitals', 'Laboratories', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Privacy', 'Public health', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements']",Proposed Rule

2013-30024,"On March 25, 2011, the Board published a notice of proposed rulemaking (``2011 proposal'') intended to facilitate the banking industry's ongoing transition to fully electronic interbank check collection and return. Based on its analysis of the comments received in response to the 2011 proposal, the Board is revising its proposed amendments to subparts C and D of Regulation CC and is requesting comment on a revised proposed rule that would, among other things, encourage depositary banks to receive and paying banks to send returned checks electronically. The Board is requesting comment on two alternative frameworks for return requirements. Under Alternative 1, the expeditious-return requirement currently imposed on paying banks and returning banks for returned checks would be eliminated; a paying bank returning a check would be required to provide the depositary bank with a notice of nonpayment of the check--regardless of the amount of the check being returned--only if the paying bank sends the returned check in paper form. Under Alternative 2, the current expeditious- return requirement--using the current two-day test--would be retained for checks being returned to a depositary bank electronically via another bank, but the notice-of-nonpayment requirement would be eliminated. The Board is proposing to retain, without change, the regulation's current same-day settlement rule for paper checks.

2013-30465,"To deliver on the promise of a 21st-Century government that is more efficient, effective and transparent, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is streamlining the Federal government's guidance on Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal awards. These modifications are a key component of a larger Federal effort to more effectively focus Federal resources on improving performance and outcomes while ensuring the financial integrity of taxpayer dollars in partnership with non-Federal stakeholders. This guidance provides a governmentwide framework for grants management which will be complemented by additional efforts to strengthen program outcomes through innovative and effective use of grant-making models, performance metrics, and evaluation. This reform of OMB guidance will reduce administrative burden for non-Federal entities receiving Federal awards while reducing the risk of waste, fraud and abuse. This final guidance supersedes and streamlines requirements from OMB Circulars A-21, A-87, A-110, and A-122 (which have been placed in OMB guidances); Circulars A-89, A-102, and A-133; and the guidance in Circular A-50 on Single Audit Act follow-up. Future reform efforts may eventually seek to incorporate the Cost Principles for Hospitals in Department of Health and Human Services regulations. Copies of the OMB Circulars that are superseded by this guidance are available on OMB's Web site at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars--default/. The final guidance consolidates the guidance previously contained in the aforementioned citations into a streamlined format that aims to improve both the clarity and accessibility. This final guidance is located in Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations. This final guidance does not broaden the scope of applicability from existing government-wide requirements, affecting Federal awards to non-Federal entities including state and local governments, Indian tribes, institutions of higher education, and nonprofit organizations.

2013-23496,"This final rule implements changes that were proposed on November 29, 2012 in a proposed rule entitled Revisions to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) To Make the Commerce Control List (CCL) Clearer. The changes in the November 29 proposed rule were informed by public comments received in response to an advance notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Commerce Control List: Revising Descriptions of Items and Foreign Availability published as part of the President's Export Control Reform (ECR) Initiative on December 9, 2010. This final rule implements changes that can be made to the CCL without requiring changes to multilateral export control regime guidelines or lists. This final rule also makes conforming changes and minor clarifications as a result of the publication of two final rules implementing the Export Control Reform Initiative: the April 16, 2013 final rule entitled Revisions to the Export Administration Regulations: Initial Implementation of Export Control Reform; and the July 8, 2013 final rule entitled Revisions to the Export Administration Regulations: Military Vehicles; Vessels of War; Submersible Vessels, Oceanographic Equipment; Related Items; and Auxiliary and Miscellaneous Items that the President Determines No Longer Warrant Control under the United States Munitions List. Lastly, this final rule is making revisions to the EAR as a result of public comments received in response to the November 29 proposed rule and to a notice of inquiry (NOI) entitled Request for Public Comments on Shipping Tolerances for Export Licenses Issued by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), that BIS published on July 5, 2012.",Final rule.,"[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE', 'name': 'Commerce Department', 'id': 54, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/commerce-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/54.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'commerce-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Bureau of Industry and Security', 'name': 'Industry and Security Bureau', 'id': 241, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/industry-and-security-bureau', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/241.json', 'parent_id': 54, 'slug': 'industry-and-security-bureau'}]","['Commerce Department', 'Industry and Security Bureau']",,2013-10-04,True,,Revisions to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) To Make the Commerce Control List (CCL) Clearer,"['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Exports', 'Inventions and patents', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Terrorism']",Rule
2013-22799,"In 1974, Congress extended the protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA or the Act) to ``domestic service'' employees, but it exempted from the Act's minimum wage and overtime provisions domestic service employees who provide ``companionship services'' to elderly people or people with illnesses, injuries, or disabilities who require assistance in caring for themselves, and it exempted from the Act's overtime provision domestic service employees who reside in the household in which they provide services. This Final Rule revises the Department's 1975 regulations implementing these amendments to the Act to better reflect Congressional intent given the changes to the home care industry and workforce since that time. Most significantly, the Department is revising the definition of ``companionship services'' to clarify and narrow the duties that fall within the term; in addition third party employers, such as home care agencies, will not be able to claim either of the exemptions. The major effect of this Final Rule is that more domestic service workers will be protected by the FLSA's minimum wage, overtime, and recordkeeping provisions.",Final rule.,"[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF LABOR', 'name': 'Labor Department', 'id': 271, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/labor-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/271.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'labor-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Wage and Hour Division', 'name': 'Wage and Hour Division', 'id': 524, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/wage-and-hour-division', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/524.json', 'parent_id': 271, 'slug': 'wage-and-hour-division'}]","['Labor Department', 'Wage and Hour Division']",2015-01-01,2013-10-01,True,,Application of the Fair Labor Standards Act to Domestic Service,"['Employment', 'Labor', 'Minimum wages', 'Wages']",Rule
