2019-20736,"This final rule reforms Medicare regulations that are identified as unnecessary, obsolete, or excessively burdensome on health care providers and suppliers. This final rule also increases the ability of health care professionals to devote resources to improving patient care by eliminating or reducing requirements that impede quality patient care or that divert resources away from furnishing high quality patient care. Additionally, this rule updates fire safety standards for Medicare and Medicaid participating End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) facilities by adopting the 2012 edition of the Life Safety Code and the 2012 edition of the Health Care Facilities Code. Finally, this final rule updates the requirements that hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These requirements are intended to conform to current standards of practice and support improvements in quality of care, reduce barriers to care, and reduce some issues that may exacerbate workforce shortage concerns.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES', 'name': 'Health and Human Services Department', 'id': 221, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/health-and-human-services-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/221.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'health-and-human-services-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services', 'name': 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services', 'id': 45, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/centers-for-medicare-medicaid-services', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/45.json', 'parent_id': 221, 'slug': 'centers-for-medicare-medicaid-services'}]"," &#8230;  patients with conditions such as <span class=""match"">Lyme</span> disease.

The final rule will improve the competency of certified applicators of RUPs, increase protection for noncertified applicators using RUPs under the direct supervision of a certified applicator through enhanced pesticide safety training and standards for supervision of noncertified applicators, and establish a minimum age requirement for certified and noncertified applicators using RUPs under the direct supervision of a certified applicator. Recognizing EPA's commitment to work more closely with Tribal governments to strengthen environmental protection in Indian country, the final rule will provide more practical options for establishing certification programs in Indian country.","[{'raw_name': 'ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY', 'name': 'Environmental Protection Agency', 'id': 145, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/environmental-protection-agency', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/145.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'environmental-protection-agency'}]"," &#8230; , such as West Nile Virus, <span class=""match"">Lyme</span> disease, Zika, and the plague &#8230; ",https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/04/2016-30332/pesticides-certification-of-pesticide-applicators,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2017-01-04/pdf/2016-30332.pdf,https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-30332.pdf?1483451125,2017-01-04,Pesticides; Certification of Pesticide Applicators,Rule

The proposed changes are intended to improve the competency of certified applicators of RUPs, increase protection for noncertified applicators of RUPs operating under the direct supervision of a certified applicator through enhanced pesticide safety training and standards for supervision of noncertified applicators, and establish a minimum age requirement for certified and noncertified applicators.

The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) completed a comprehensive stock assessment for river herring in May 2012 which covers over 50 river specific stocks throughout the range of the species in the United States. The ASMFC stock assessment contained much of the information necessary to make an ESA listing determination for both species; however, any deficiencies were addressed through focused workshops and working group meetings and review of additional sources of information. Based on the best scientific and commercial information available, we have determined that listing alewife as threatened or endangered under the ESA is not warranted at this time.

Based on our evaluation, we propose to remove the gray wolf from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife but to maintain endangered status for the Mexican wolf by listing it as a subspecies (Canis lupus baileyi). We propose these actions because the best available scientific and commercial information indicates that the currently listed entity is not a valid species under the Act and that the Mexican wolf (C. l. baileyi) is an endangered subspecies. In addition, we recognize recent taxonomic information indicating that the gray wolf subspecies, Canis lupus lycaon, which occurs in southeastern Canada and historically occurred in the northeastern United States and portions of the upper Midwest (eastern and western Great Lakes regions) United States, should be recognized as a separate species, Canis lycaon. This proposed rule also constitutes the completion of a status review for gray wolves in the Pacific Northwest initiated on May 5, 2011. Finally, this proposed rule replaces our May 5, 2011, proposed action to remove protections for C. lupus in all or portions of 29 eastern states (76 FR 26086).","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR', 'name': 'Interior Department', 'id': 253, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'interior-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'id': 197, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/fish-and-wildlife-service', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/197.json', 'parent_id': 253, 'slug': 'fish-and-wildlife-service'}]"," &#8230;  significantly affect C. l. nubilus.

2012-21972,"EPA and NHTSA, on behalf of the Department of Transportation, are issuing final rules to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy for light-duty vehicles for model years 2017 and beyond. On May 21, 2010, President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum requesting that NHTSA and EPA develop through notice and comment rulemaking a coordinated National Program to improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions of light-duty vehicles for model years 2017-2025, building on the success of the first phase of the National Program for these vehicles for model years 2012-2016. This final rule, consistent with the President's request, responds to the country's critical need to address global climate change and to reduce oil consumption. NHTSA is finalizing Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for model years 2017-2021 and issuing augural standards for model years 2022-2025 under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act. NHTSA will set final standards for model years 2022-2025 in a future rulemaking. EPA is finalizing greenhouse gas emissions standards for model years 2017- 2025 under the Clean Air Act. These standards apply to passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles, and represent the continuation of a harmonized and consistent National Program. Under the National Program automobile manufacturers will be able to continue building a single light-duty national fleet that satisfies all requirements under both programs while ensuring that consumers still have a full range of vehicle choices that are available today. EPA is also finalizing minor changes to the regulations applicable to model years 2012-2016, with respect to air conditioner performance, nitrous oxides measurement, off-cycle technology credits, and police and emergency vehicles.","[{'raw_name': 'ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY', 'name': 'Environmental Protection Agency', 'id': 145, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/environmental-protection-agency', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/145.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'environmental-protection-agency'}, {'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION', 'name': 'Transportation Department', 'id': 492, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/transportation-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/492.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'transportation-department'}, {'raw_name': 'National Highway Traffic Safety Administration', 'name': 'National Highway Traffic Safety Administration', 'id': 345, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-highway-traffic-safety-administration', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/345.json', 'parent_id': 492, 'slug': 'national-highway-traffic-safety-administration'}]"," &#8230; . 2011).

2011-25359,"We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or USFWS), are proposing to remove the gray wolf (Canis lupus) in Wyoming from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. This rule focuses on the Wyoming portion of the Northern Rocky Mountain (NRM) Distinct Population Segment (DPS), except where discussion of the larger Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) or NRM metapopulation (a population that exists as partially isolated sets of subpopulations) is necessary to understand impacts to wolves in Wyoming. The best scientific and commercial data available indicate that wolves in Wyoming are recovered and no longer meet the definition of endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Wyoming's wolf population is stable, threats are addressed, and a post-delisting monitoring and management framework has been developed. However, additional changes to Wyoming State law and Wyoming Game and Fish Commission regulations are necessary for implementation. We expect the State of Wyoming to adopt the necessary statutory and regulatory changes within the next several months. If this proposal is finalized, the gray wolf would be delisted in Wyoming, the nonessential experimental population designation would be removed, and future management for this species, except in National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges, would be conducted by the appropriate State or Tribal wildlife agencies.

2011-15064,"Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C), the National Park Service is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a Deer and Vegetation Management Plan at Fire Island National Seashore, New York. The purpose of taking action at this time is to address issues associated with the abundance and distribution of white-tailed deer at Fire Island National Seashore (Seashore). The issues include impacts from deer on the natural and cultural resources of the Seashore as well as impacts resulting from deer-human interaction. Actions addressing these issues will be designed and undertaken in support of the long-term protection, preservation, and restoration of Seashore resources. Information collected as part of research conducted at the Seashore has indicated the need for a management plan to address changes in deer abundance and deer behavior due to the presence of human food sources and habituation to the unthreatening presence of humans; adverse impacts on native vegetation resulting from current levels of deer browsing; and adverse impacts on natural and cultural resources at the William Floyd Estate resulting from current deer population levels.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR', 'name': 'Interior Department', 'id': 253, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'interior-department'}, {'raw_name': 'National Park Service', 'name': 'National Park Service', 'id': 362, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-park-service', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/362.json', 'parent_id': 253, 'slug': 'national-park-service'}]"," &#8230;  Island and the appearance of <span class=""match"">Lyme</span> disease among island residents and &#8230;  across the island; ecology of <span class=""match"">Lyme</span> disease and its host vectors &#8230; ",https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/06/17/2011-15064/deer-and-vegetation-management-planenvironmental-impact-statement-fire-island-national-seashore-new,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2011-06-17/pdf/2011-15064.pdf,,2011-06-17,"Deer and Vegetation Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement, Fire Island National Seashore, New York",Notice

2011-9557,"We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or USFWS) are re-evaluating the listing of the Minnesota population of gray wolves (Canis lupus) and propose to revise it to conform to current statutory and policy requirements. We propose to identify the Minnesota population as a Western Great Lakes (WGL) Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of the gray wolf and to remove this DPS from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. We propose these actions because the best available scientific and commercial information indicates that the WGL DPS does not meet the definitions of threatened or endangered under the Act. This proposed rule, if made final, would remove the currently designated critical habitat for the gray wolf in Minnesota and Michigan and the current special regulations for gray wolves in Minnesota. We also propose to revise the range of the gray wolf (the species C. lupus) by removing all or parts of 29 eastern states that we now recognize were not part of the historical range of the gray wolf. New information indicates that these areas should not have been included in the original listing of the gray wolf. In this proposed rule, we recognize recent taxonomic information indicating that the gray wolf subspecies Canis lupus lycaon should be elevated to the full species C. lycaon. Given that a complete status review of this newly recognized species has never been conducted, we are initiating a rangewide review of the conservation status of C. lycaon in the United States and Canada. This rule also constitutes the initiation of our five-year review of the status of gray wolves under section 4(c)(2) of the Act, as well as the initiation of status reviews specific to gray wolves in the Pacific Northwest and Mexican wolves in the Southwest United States and Mexico.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR', 'name': 'Interior Department', 'id': 253, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'interior-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'id': 197, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/fish-and-wildlife-service', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/197.json', 'parent_id': 253, 'slug': 'fish-and-wildlife-service'}]"," &#8230;  in the WGL wolf population.

E9-5981,"We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or USFWS) identify the Western Great Lakes (WGL) Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of the gray wolf (Canis lupus). The geographic extent of this DPS includes all of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan; the eastern half of North Dakota and South Dakota; the northern half of Iowa; the northern portions of Illinois and Indiana; and the northwestern portion of Ohio. We also revise the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife established under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act) by removing gray wolves within the WGL DPS. We are taking these actions because available data indicate that this DPS no longer meets the definitions of threatened or endangered under the Act. The threats have been reduced or eliminated, as evidenced by a population that is stable or increasing in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and greatly exceeds the numerical recovery criteria established in its recovery plan. Completed State wolf management plans will provide adequate protection and management of the WGL DPS after this revision of the listing. This final rule removes this DPS from the lists of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife, removes the currently designated critical habitat for the gray wolf in Minnesota and Michigan, and removes the current special regulations for gray wolves in Minnesota. On April 16, 2007, three parties filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of the Interior (Department) and the Service, challenging the Service's February 8, 2007 (72 FR 6052), identification and delisting of the WGL DPS. On September 29, 2008, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the plaintiffs (Humane Society of the United States v. Kempthorne, No. 1:07-CV-00677 (D.D.C.). In that ruling the court vacated and remanded the Service's application of the February 8, 2007 (72 FR 6052), final delisting rule for the WGL DPS of the gray wolf. On remand, the Service was directed to provide an explanation as to how simultaneously identifying and delisting a DPS is consistent with the Act's text, structure, policy objectives, legislative history, and any relevant judicial interpretations. This final rule addresses the September 29, 2008, court ruling.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR', 'name': 'Interior Department', 'id': 253, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'interior-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'id': 197, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/fish-and-wildlife-service', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/197.json', 'parent_id': 253, 'slug': 'fish-and-wildlife-service'}]"," &#8230;  State (Paul in litt. 2005).

E9-5991,"Under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), identify a distinct population segment (DPS) of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) in the Northern Rocky Mountains (NRM) of the United States and revise the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife by removing gray wolves within NRM DPS boundaries, except in Wyoming. The NRM gray wolf DPS encompasses the eastern one-third of Washington and Oregon, a small part of north-central Utah, and all of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. Our current estimate for 2008 indicates the NRM DPS contains approximately 1,639 wolves (491 in Montana; 846 in Idaho; 302 in Wyoming) in 95 breeding pairs (34 in Montana; 39 in Idaho; 22 in Wyoming). These numbers are about 5 times higher than the minimum population recovery goal and 3 times higher than the minimum breeding pair recovery goal. The end of 2008 will mark the ninth consecutive year the population has exceeded our numeric and distributional recovery goals. The States of Montana and Idaho have adopted State laws, management plans, and regulations that meet the requirements of the Act and will conserve a recovered wolf population into the foreseeable future. In our proposed rule (72 FR 6106, February 8, 2007), we noted that removing the Act's protections in Wyoming was dependant upon the State's wolf law (W.S. 11-6-302 et seq. and 23-1-101, et seq. in House Bill 0213) and wolf management plan adequately conserving Wyoming's portion of a recovered NRM wolf population. In light of the July 18, 2008, U.S. District Court order, we reexamined Wyoming law, its management plans and implementing regulations, and now determine they are not adequate regulatory mechanisms for the purposes of the Act. We determine that the best scientific and commercial data available demonstrates that (1) the NRM DPS is not threatened or endangered throughout ``all'' of its range (i.e., not threatened or endangered throughout all of the DPS); and (2) the Wyoming portion of the range represents a significant portion of range where the species remains in danger of extinction because of inadequate regulatory mechanisms. Thus, this final rule removes the Act's protections throughout the NRM DPS except for Wyoming. Wolves in Wyoming will continue to be regulated as a non-essential, experimental population per 50 CFR 17.84(i) and (n).","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR', 'name': 'Interior Department', 'id': 253, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'interior-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'id': 197, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/fish-and-wildlife-service', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/197.json', 'parent_id': 253, 'slug': 'fish-and-wildlife-service'}]"," &#8230;  carrying capacity in suitable habitat.

08-798,"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service, we or us), hereby establishes a distinct population segment (DPS) of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) in the Northern Rocky Mountains (NRM) of the United States (U.S.) and removes this DPS from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. The NRM gray wolf DPS encompasses the eastern one-third of Washington and Oregon, a small part of north-central Utah, and all of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. Based on the best scientific and commercial data available, the NRM DPS is no longer an endangered or threatened species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). The NRM DPS has exceeded its biological recovery goals, and all threats in the foreseeable future have been sufficiently reduced or eliminated. The States of Idaho (2002) and Montana (2003) adopted State laws and management plans that meet the requirements of the Act and will conserve a recovered wolf population into the foreseeable future. In 2007, following a change in State law, Wyoming drafted and approved a revised wolf management plan (Wyoming 2007). We have determined that this plan meets the requirements of the Act as providing adequate regulatory protections to conserve Wyoming's portion of a recovered wolf population into the foreseeable future. Our determination is conditional upon the 2007 Wyoming wolf management law (W.S. 11-6-302 et seq. and 23-1-101, et seq. in House Bill 0213) being fully in effect and the wolf management plan being legally authorized by Wyoming statutes. If the law is not in effect (discussed in more detail below) within 20 days from the date of this publication, we will withdraw this final rule and replace it with an alternate final rule that removes the Act's protections throughout all of the DPS, except the significant portion of the gray wolf's range in northwestern Wyoming outside the National Parks.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR', 'name': 'Interior Department', 'id': 253, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'interior-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'id': 197, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/fish-and-wildlife-service', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/197.json', 'parent_id': 253, 'slug': 'fish-and-wildlife-service'}]"," &#8230;  northern GYA in spring 2005.

07-1920,"We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems, and to implement certain provisions made by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-171), the Medicare Improvements and Extension Act under Division B, Title I of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-432), and the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (Pub. L. 109-417). In addition, in the Addendum to this proposed rule, we describe the proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs. We also are setting forth proposed rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals and hospital units excluded from the IPPS that are paid in full or in part on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits or that have a portion of a prospective payment system payment based on reasonable cost principles. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2007. In this proposed rule, we discuss our proposals to further refine the diagnosis-related group (DRG) system under the IPPS to better recognize severity of illness among patients--for FY 2008, we are proposing to adopt a Medicare Severity DRG (MS-DRG) classification system for the IPPS. We are also proposing to use the structure of the proposed MS-DRG system for the LTCH prospective payment system (referred to as MS-LTC-DRGs) for FY 2008. Among the other policy changes that we are proposing to make are changes related to: Limited revisions of the reclassification of cases to proposed MS-DRGs, the proposed relative weights for the proposed MS- LTC-DRGs; the wage data, including the occupational mix data, used to compute the wage index; applications for new technologies and medical services add-on payments; payments to hospitals for the indirect costs of graduate medical education; submission of hospital quality data; provisions governing application of sanctions relating to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986 (EMTALA); provisions governing disclosure of physician ownership in hospitals and patient safety measures; and provisions relating to services furnished to beneficiaries in custody of penal authorities.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES', 'name': 'Health and Human Services Department', 'id': 221, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/health-and-human-services-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/221.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'health-and-human-services-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services', 'name': 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services', 'id': 45, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/centers-for-medicare-medicaid-services', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/45.json', 'parent_id': 221, 'slug': 'centers-for-medicare-medicaid-services'}]"," &#8230;  fever, unspecified.

07-487,"Under the Endangered Species Act (Act), we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to establish a distinct population segment (DPS) of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) in the Northern Rocky Mountains (NRM) of the United States. The proposed NRM DPS of the gray wolf encompasses the eastern one-third of Washington and Oregon, a small part of north-central Utah, and all of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. We are also proposing to remove the gray wolf in the NRM DPS from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife under the Act, because threats will have been reduced or eliminated if Wyoming adopts a State law and wolf management plan that we believe will adequately conserve wolves. The States of Montana and Idaho have adopted State laws and management plans that would conserve a recovered wolf population into the foreseeable future. However, Wyoming State law and its wolf management plan are not sufficient to conserve Wyoming's portion of a recovered NRM wolf population at this time. Therefore, if Wyoming fails to modify its management regime to adequately conserve wolves, we will keep a significant portion of the range in the Wyoming portion of the NRM DPS because there are not adequate regulatory mechanisms in that area. In this situation, wolves in the significant portion of the range in northwestern Wyoming, outside the National Parks, will retain their nonessential experimental status under section 10(j) of the Act. We will remove the remainder of the NRM DPS from the List of Endangered and Threatened Species. Any gray wolves in the remainder of Wyoming outside the National Parks and those portions of Washington, Oregon, and Utah in the NRM DPS, are not essential to conserving the NRM wolf population and these areas do not constitute a significant portion of the range in the DPS. Therefore these areas will not remain listed. We are also soliciting comments regarding our intention to use section 6 agreements to allow States outside the NRM DPS with Service-approved wolf management plans to assume management of listed wolves, including nonlethal and lethal control of problem wolves.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR', 'name': 'Interior Department', 'id': 253, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'interior-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'id': 197, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/fish-and-wildlife-service', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/197.json', 'parent_id': 253, 'slug': 'fish-and-wildlife-service'}]"," &#8230;  northern GYA in spring 2005.

The proposed rule describes proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare hospital outpatient services paid under the prospective payment system. These changes would be applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2007. In addition, this proposed rule would revise the current list of procedures that are approved when furnished in a Medicare-approved ambulatory surgical center (ASC), which would be applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2007. Further, this proposed rule would revise the ASC facility payment system to implement provisions of the MMA and other applicable statutory requirements, and update the ASC payment rates. Changes to the ASC facility payment system and the payment rates would be applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2008. This proposed rule would revise the emergency medical screening requirements for critical access hospitals (CAHs). In addition, this proposed rule would support implementation of a restructuring of the contracting entities responsibilities and functions that support the adjudication of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claims. This restructuring is directed by section 1874A of the Act, as added by section 911 of the MMA. The prior separate Medicare intermediary and Medicare carrier contracting authorities under Title XVIII of the Act have been replaced with the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority. This proposed rule would also continue to implement the requirements of the DRA that require that we expand the ``starter set'' of 10 quality measures that we used in FY 2005 and FY 2006 for the hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Reporting Hospital Quality Data for the Annual Payment Update (RHQDAPU) program. We began to adopt expanded measures effective for payments beginning in FY 2007. We are proposing to add additional quality measures to the expanded set of measures for FY 2008 payment purposes. These measures include the HCAHPS[supreg] survey, as well as Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP, formerly Surgical Infection Prevention (SIP)), and Mortality quality measures.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES', 'name': 'Health and Human Services Department', 'id': 221, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/health-and-human-services-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/221.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'health-and-human-services-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services', 'name': 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services', 'id': 45, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/centers-for-medicare-medicaid-services', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/45.json', 'parent_id': 221, 'slug': 'centers-for-medicare-medicaid-services'}]"," &#8230; , prp-t, im

06-1102,"We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce our intention to conduct rulemaking to establish a distinct population segment (DPS) of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) in the Northern Rocky Mountains of the United States (NRM). The NRM DPS of gray wolf encompasses the eastern one-third of Washington and Oregon, a small part of north-central Utah, and all of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. The threats to the wolf population in the NRM DPS have been reduced or eliminated as evidenced by the population exceeding the numerical, distributional, and temporal recovery goals each year since 2002. The States of Montana and Idaho have adopted State laws and State wolf management plans that would conserve a recovered NRM wolf population within their boundaries into the foreseeable future. However, we have determined that Wyoming State law and its wolf management plan do not provide the necessary regulatory mechanism to assure that Wyoming's share of a recovered NRM wolf population will be conserved if the ESA's protections were removed. Therefore, we intend to conduct a future rulemaking to propose that the gray wolf in the NRM wolf DPS be removed from the List of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), as amended, if Wyoming adopts a State law and a State wolf management plan that is approved by the Service. Concerns regarding the Wyoming plan would have to be resolved before a NRM DPS delisting could be finalized. This ANPRM is being issued in advance of completion of the 12 month status review of NRM wolves. This status review remains in progress.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR', 'name': 'Interior Department', 'id': 253, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'interior-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'id': 197, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/fish-and-wildlife-service', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/197.json', 'parent_id': 253, 'slug': 'fish-and-wildlife-service'}]"," &#8230;  wolves' high exposure to it.

05-10882,"Section 8(c)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (USHA) requires the Secretary to publish FMRs periodically, but not less than annually, adjusted to be effective on October 1 of each year. Today's notice proposes FMRs for FY2006. The proposed numbers would amend FMR schedules used to determine payment standard amounts for the Housing Choice Voucher program, to determine initial renewal rents for some expiring project-based Section 8 contracts, and to determine initial rents for housing assistance payment (HAP) contracts in the Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy program. Other programs may require use of FMRs for other purposes. The proposed FY2006 FMRs in this notice differ from the final FY2005 and previous year FMRs in that they were calculated using the revised Office of Management and Budget (OMB) area definitions that were issued in 2003. For FY2006, HUD is using the county-based statistical areas as defined by OMB, with some modifications. The FMR estimates have been trended to April 2006, the midpoint of FY2006.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT', 'name': 'Housing and Urban Development Department', 'id': 228, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/housing-and-urban-development-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/228.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'housing-and-urban-development-department'}]"," &#8230; , CT HUD Metro FMR Area.

The policy changes concern: Medicare Economic Index, practice expense for professional component services, definition of diabetes for diabetes self-management training, supplemental survey data for practice expense, geographic practice cost indices, and several coding issues. In addition, this rule updates the codes subject to the physician self-referral prohibition. We also make revisions to the sustainable growth rate and the anesthesia conversion factor. These changes will ensure that our payment systems are updated to reflect changes in medical practice and the relative value of services. We are also finalizing the calendar year (CY) 2003 interim RVUs and are issuing interim RVUs for new and revised procedure codes for CY 2004. As required by the statute, we are announcing that the physician fee schedule update for CY 2004 is -4.5 percent, the initial estimate of the sustainable growth rate for CY 2004 is 7.4 percent, and the conversion factor for CY 2004 is $35.1339.

This edition of the FAFB is a review of CDC and ATSDR Fiscal Year 2004 competitive assistance programs. Financial assistance programs include grants and cooperative agreements. The FAFB contains most of CDC's and ATSDR's new competitive opportunities; however, additional grant and cooperative agreement opportunities may become available because of programmatic planning and Congressional action. The funding opportunities will be published in the Federal Register, CDC's and ATSDR's Internet Web site, which can be obtained by accessing http://www.cdc.gov/od/pgo/funding/grantmain.htm, and in addition may be published in the NIH Guide For Grants and Contracts. CDC and ATSDR, as well as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has been very busy this year. In support of health related disease control and prevention activities, we are striving to provide simpler avenues for eligible organizations to apply for funding. We are working in cooperation with HHS and other organizations within HHS to improve our processes related to delivering CDC funding opportunities and awarding grants to eligible applicants. We are currently planning to deploy a new grants management information system, and have implemented processes to streamline our grant making operations. We are participating in pilot programs being conducted throughout the federal government that are designed to move the granting of federal dollars into the world of electronic government.

03-7018,"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or we) hereby changes the classification of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We establish three distinct population segments (DPS) for the gray wolf in the conterminous United States. Gray wolves in the Western DPS and the Eastern DPS are reclassified from endangered to threatened, except where already classified as threatened or as an experimental population. Gray wolves in the Southwestern DPS retain their previous endangered or experimental population status. All three existing gray wolf experimental population designations are retained and are not affected by this rule. Gray wolves are removed from the protections of the Act in all or parts of 16 southern and eastern States where the species historically did not occur. We establish a new special regulation under section 4(d) of the Act for the threatened Western DPS to increase our ability to respond to wolf-human conflicts outside the two experimental population areas in the Western DPS. A second section 4(d) special regulation applies provisions similar to those previously in effect in Minnesota to most of the Eastern DPS. We find that these special rules are necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of the Western DPS and the Eastern DPS. The classification, under the Act, of captive gray wolves is determined by the location from which they, or their ancestors, were removed from the wild. This final rule does not affect the protection currently afforded by the Act to the red wolf (Canis rufus), a separate species found in the southeastern United States that is listed as endangered.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR', 'name': 'Interior Department', 'id': 253, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'interior-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'id': 197, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/fish-and-wildlife-service', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/197.json', 'parent_id': 253, 'slug': 'fish-and-wildlife-service'}]"," &#8230;  years, primarily resulting from mange.

02-32503,"This final rule with comment period refines the resource-based practice expense relative value units (RVUs) and makes other changes to Medicare Part B payment policy. In addition, as required by statute, we are announcing the physician fee schedule update for CY 2003. The update to the physician fee schedule occurs as a result of a calculation methodology specified by law. That law required the Department to set annual updates based in part on estimates of several factors. Although subsequent after-the-fact data indicate that actual increases were different to some degree from earlier estimates, the law does not permit those estimates to be revised. A subsequent law required estimates to be revised for FY 2000 and beyond. Although we have exhaustively examined opportunities for a different interpretation of law that would allow us to correct the flaw in the formula administratively, current law does not permit such an interpretation. Accordingly, without Congressional action to address the current legal framework, the Department is compelled to announce herein a physician fee schedule update for CY 2003 of -4.4 percent. Because the Department would adopt a change in the formula that determines the physician update if the law permitted it, we have examined how proper adjustments to past data could result in a positive update. The Department believes that revisions of estimates used to establish the sustainable growth rates (SGR) for fiscal years (FY) 1998 and 1999 and Medicare volume performance standards (MVPS) for 1990-1996 would, under present calculations, result in a positive update. The Department intends to work closely with Congress to develop legislation that could permit a positive update, and hopes that such legislation can be passed before the negative update takes effect. Because the Department wishes to change the update promptly in the event that Congress provides the Department legal authority to do so, we are requesting comments regarding how physician fee schedule rates could and should be recalculated prospectively in the event that Congress provides the Department with legal authority to revise estimates used to establish the sustainable growth rates (SGR) and for 1998 and 1999 and the NVPS for 1990-1996. The other policy changes concern: the pricing of the technical component for positron emission tomography (PET) scans, Medicare qualifications for clinical nurse specialists, a process to add or delete services to the definition of telehealth, the definition for ZZZ global periods, global period for surface radiation, and an endoscopic base for urology codes. In addition, this rule updates the codes subject to physician self-referral prohibitions. We are expanding the definition of a screening fecal-occult blood test and are modifying our regulations to expand coverage for additional colorectal cancer screening tests through our national coverage determination process. We also make revisions to the sustainable growth rate, the anesthesia conversion factor, and the work values for some gastroenterologic services. We are making these changes to ensure that our payment systems are updated to reflect changes in medical practice and the relative value of services. This final rule also clarifies the enrollment of physical and occupational therapists as therapists in private practice and clarifies the policy regarding services and supplies incident to a physician's professional services. In addition, this final rule discusses physical and occupational therapy payment caps and makes technical changes to the definition of outpatient rehabilitation services. In addition, we are finalizing the calendar year (CY) 2002 interim RVUs and are issuing interim RVUs for new and revised procedure codes for calendar year (CY) 2003. As required by the statute, we are announcing that the physician fee schedule update for CY 2003 is -4.4 percent, the initial estimate of the sustainable growth rate for CY 2003 is 7.6 percent, and the conversion factor for CY 2003 is $34.5920. This final rule will also allow registered nurses (RNs) to provide emergency care in certain critical access hospitals (CAHs) in frontier areas (an area with fewer than six residents per square mile) or remote locations (locations designated in a State's rural health plan that we have approved.) This policy applies if the State, following consultation with the State Boards of Medicine and Nursing, and in accordance with State law, requests that RNs be included, along with a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, a physician's assistant, or a nurse practitioner with training or experience in emergency care, as personnel authorized to provide emergency services in CAHs in frontier areas or remote locations.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES', 'name': 'Health and Human Services Department', 'id': 221, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/health-and-human-services-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/221.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'health-and-human-services-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services', 'name': 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services', 'id': 45, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/centers-for-medicare-medicaid-services', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/45.json', 'parent_id': 221, 'slug': 'centers-for-medicare-medicaid-services'}]"," &#8230;

In addition, it describes changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare hospital outpatient services paid under the prospective payment system. These changes are applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2003.

In addition, this rule responds to public comments received on the November 2, 2001 interim final rule with comment period (66 FR 55850) that set forth the criteria the Secretary will use to establish new categories of medical devices eligible for transitional pass-through payment under the Medicare's hospital outpatient prospective payment system.

01-24595,"Section 120(c) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket. The docket is to contain certain information about Federal facilities that manage hazardous waste or from which hazardous substances have been or may be released. (As defined by CERCLA section 101(22), a release is any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing into the environment.) CERCLA requires that the docket be updated every six months, as new facilities are reported to EPA by Federal agencies. The following list identifies the Federal facilities to be included in this fourteenth update of the docket and includes facilities not previously listed on the docket and reported to EPA since the last update of the docket, 65 FR 83222, December 29, 2000, which was current as of August 28, 2000. SARA, as amended by the Defense Authorization Act of 1997, specifies that, for each Federal facility that is included on the docket during an update, evaluation shall be completed in accordance with a reasonable schedule. Such site evaluation activities will help determine whether the facility should be included on the National Priorities List (NPL) and will provide EPA and the public with valuable information about the facility. In addition to the list of additions to the docket, this notice includes a section that comprises revisions (that is, corrections and deletions) of the previous docket list. This update contains eleven additions and twenty-three deletions since the previous update, as well as numerous other corrections to the docket list. At the time of publication of this notice, the new total number of Federal facilities listed on the docket is 2,214.","[{'raw_name': 'ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY', 'name': 'Environmental Protection Agency', 'id': 145, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/environmental-protection-agency', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/145.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'environmental-protection-agency'}]"," &#8230;  STONE'S RANCH ROAD

01-18951,"This proposed rule would refine the resource-based practice expense relative value units and make several changes to Medicare Part B payment. The policy changes concern services and supplies incident to a physician's professional service; anesthesia base unit variations; recognition of CPT tracking codes; and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and clinical nurse specialists performing screening sigmoidoscopies. We are proposing these refinements and changes to ensure that our payment systems are updated to reflect changes in medical practice and the relative value of services. We are soliciting comments on the proposed policy changes as well as comments on the payment policy for CPT modifier 62 that is used to report the work of co-surgeons. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 modernizes the mammography screening benefit and authorizes payment under the physician fee schedule effective January 1, 2002; provides for biennial screening pelvic examinations for certain beneficiaries effective July 1, 2001; provides for annual glaucoma screenings for high-risk beneficiaries effective January 1, 2002; expands coverage for screening colonoscopies to all beneficiaries effective July 1, 2001; establishes coverage for medical nutrition therapy services for certain beneficiaries effective January 1, 2002; expands payment for telehealth services effective October 1, 2001; requires certain Indian Health Service providers to be paid for some services under the physician fee schedule effective July 1, 2001; and revises the payment for certain physician pathology services effective January 1, 2001. This proposed rule would conform our regulations to reflect the statutory provisions.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES', 'name': 'Health and Human Services Department', 'id': 221, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/health-and-human-services-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/221.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'health-and-human-services-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services', 'name': 'Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services', 'id': 45, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/centers-for-medicare-medicaid-services', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/45.json', 'parent_id': 221, 'slug': 'centers-for-medicare-medicaid-services'}]"," &#8230;

01-725,"The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is revising its rule addressing the recording and reporting of occupational injuries and illnesses (29 CFR parts 1904 and 1952), including the forms employers use to record those injuries and illnesses. The revisions to the final rule will produce more useful injury and illness records, collect better information about the incidence of occupational injuries and illnesses on a national basis, promote improved employee awareness and involvement in the recording and reporting of job-related injuries and illnesses, simplify the injury and illness recordkeeping system for employers, and permit increased use of computers and telecommunications technology for OSHA recordkeeping purposes. This rulemaking completes a larger overall effort to revise Part 1904 of Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Two sections of Part 1904 have already been revised in earlier rulemakings. A rule titled Reporting fatalities and multiple hospitalization incidents to OSHA, became effective May 2, 1994 and has been incorporated into this final rule as Sec. 1904.39. A second rule entitled Annual OSHA injury and illness survey of ten or more employers became effective on March 13, 1997 and has been incorporated into this final rule as Sec. 1904.41. The final rule being published today also revises 29 CFR 1952.4, Injury and Illness Recording and Reporting Requirements, which prescribes the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for States that have an occupational safety and health program approved by OSHA under Sec. 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (the ``Act'' or ``OSH Act'').","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF LABOR', 'name': 'Labor Department', 'id': 271, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/labor-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/271.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'labor-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Occupational Safety and Health Administration', 'name': 'Occupational Safety and Health Administration', 'id': 386, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/occupational-safety-and-health-administration', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/386.json', 'parent_id': 271, 'slug': 'occupational-safety-and-health-administration'}]"," &#8230;  staphylococcus infection (“staph” infection) or <span class=""match"">Lyme</span> disease, and the workplace is &#8230;  a staph infection.

The changes include: refinement of resource-based practice expense relative value units (RVUs); the geographic practice cost indices; resource-based malpractice RVUs; critical care RVUs; care plan oversight and physician certification and recertification for home health services; observation care codes; ocular photodynamic therapy and other ophthalmological treatments; electrical bioimpedance; antigen supply; and the implantation of ventricular assist devices. This rule also addresses the comments received on the May 3, 2000 interim final rule on the supplemental survey criteria and makes modifications to the criteria for data submitted in 2001. Based on public comments we are withdrawing our proposals related to the global period for insertion, removal, and replacement of pacemakers and cardioverter defibrillators and low intensity ultrasound. This final rule also discusses or clarifies the payment policy for incomplete medical direction, pulse oximetry services, outpatient therapy supervision, outpatient therapy caps, HCPCS ``G'' Codes, and the second 5-year refinement of work RVUs for services furnished beginning January 1, 2002. In addition, we are finalizing the calendar year (CY) 2000 interim physician work RVUs and are issuing interim RVUs for new and revised codes for CY 2001. We are making these changes to ensure that our payment systems are updated to reflect changes in medical practice and the relative value of services. This final rule also announces the CY 2001 Medicare physician fee schedule conversion factor under the Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance (Part B) program as required by section 1848(d) of the Social Security Act.

00-17621,"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or we) proposes to change the classification of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Increases in gray wolf numbers, expansion of the species' occupied range, and progress toward achieving the reclassification and delisting criteria of several approved gray wolf recovery plans show that the species' current classification is no longer appropriate throughout most of its range. This proposal, if finalized, will establish four distinct population segments (DPSs) for the gray wolf in the United States and Mexico. Gray wolves in the Western Great Lakes DPS, the Western DPS, and the Northeastern DPS will be reclassified from endangered to threatened, except where already classified as an experimental population or as threatened. Gray wolves in the Southwestern (Mexican) DPS will retain their endangered status. All three existing gray wolf experimental population designations will be retained and are not affected by this proposal. Gray wolves will be removed from the protections of the Act in all other areas of the 48 conterminous states. We are proposing a new special regulation under section 4(d) of the Act for the threatened Western DPS to increase our ability to respond to wolf-human conflicts outside the two experimental population areas in the northern United States Rockies. We are proposing a second special regulation under section 4(d) that would apply to the Northeastern DPS to reduce wolf- human conflicts and land-use restrictions. A third section 4(d) special regulation would expand the current Minnesota wolf depredation program into Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, and South Dakota. The classification, under the Act, of captive gray wolves would be determined by the location from which they, or their ancestors, were removed from the wild. We would revise our existing recovery plans, as appropriate to accommodate changes necessitated by this proposal, if finalized. This proposal does not affect the protection currently afforded by the Act to the red wolf (C. rufus), a separate species that is listed as endangered in the southeastern United States.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR', 'name': 'Interior Department', 'id': 253, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/interior-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/253.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'interior-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'name': 'Fish and Wildlife Service', 'id': 197, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/fish-and-wildlife-service', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/197.json', 'parent_id': 253, 'slug': 'fish-and-wildlife-service'}]"," &#8230;  years, primarily due to mange.

99-29181,"Today's regulations (Phase II) expand the existing National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) storm water program (Phase I) to address storm water discharges from small municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) (those serving less than 100,000 persons) and construction sites that disturb one to five acres. Although these sources are automatically designated by today's rule, the rule allows for the exclusion of certain sources from the national program based on a demonstration of the lack of impact on water quality, as well as the inclusion of others based on a higher likelihood of localized adverse impact on water quality. Today's regulations also exclude from the NPDES program storm water discharges from industrial facilities that have ``no exposure'' of industrial activities or materials to storm water. Finally, today's rule extends from August 7, 2001 until March 10, 2003 the deadline by which certain industrial facilities owned by small MS4s must obtain coverage under an NPDES permit. This rule establishes a cost-effective, flexible approach for reducing environmental harm by storm water discharges from many point sources of storm water that are currently unregulated. EPA believes that the implementation of the six minimum measures identified for small MS4s should significantly reduce pollutants in urban storm water compared to existing levels in a cost-effective manner. Similarly, EPA believes that implementation of Best Management Practices (BMP) controls at small construction sites will also result in a significant reduction in pollutant discharges and an improvement in surface water quality. EPA believes this rule will result in monetized financial, recreational and health benefits, as well as benefits that EPA has been unable to monetize. Expected benefits include reduced scouring and erosion of streambeds, improved aesthetic quality of waters, reduced eutrophication of aquatic systems, benefit to wildlife and endangered and threatened species, tourism benefits, biodiversity benefits and reduced costs for siting reservoirs. In addition, the costs of industrial storm water controls will decrease due to the exclusion of storm water discharges from facilities where there is ``no exposure'' of storm water to industrial activities and materials.","[{'raw_name': 'Revision of the Water Pollution Control Program Addressing Storm Water'}, {'raw_name': 'ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY', 'name': 'Environmental Protection Agency', 'id': 145, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/environmental-protection-agency', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/145.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'environmental-protection-agency'}]"," &#8230;   East Haven town

98-23383,"As required by sections 4521, 4522, and 4523 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, this proposed rule would eliminate the formula- driven overpayment for certain outpatient hospital services, extend reductions in payment for costs of hospital outpatient services, and establish in regulations a prospective payment system for hospital outpatient services (and for Medicare Part B services furnished to inpatients who have no Part A coverage). The prospective payment system would simplify our current payment system and apply to all hospitals, including those that are excluded from the inpatient prospective payment system. The Balanced Budget Act provides for implementation of the prospective payment system effective January 1, 1999, but delays application of the system to cancer hospitals until January 1, 2000. The hospital outpatient prospective payment system would also apply to partial hospitalization services furnished by community mental health centers. Although the statutory effective date for the outpatient prospective payment system is January 1, 1999, implementation of the new system will have to be delayed because of year 2000 systems concerns. The demands on intermediary bill processing systems and HCFA internal systems to become compliant for the year 2000 preclude making the major systems changes that are required to implement the prospective payment system. The outpatient prospective payment system will be implemented for all hospitals and community mental health centers as soon as possible after January 1, 2000, and a notice of the anticipated implementation date will be published in the Federal Register at least 90 days in advance. This document also proposes new requirements for provider departments and provider-based entities. These proposed changes, as revised based on our consideration of public comments, will be effective 30 days after publication of a final rule. This proposed rule would also implement section 9343(c) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, which prohibits Medicare payment for nonphysician services furnished to a hospital outpatient by a provider or supplier other than a hospital, unless the services are furnished under an arrangement with the hospital. This section also authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General to impose a civil money penalty, not to exceed $10,000, against any individual or entity who knowingly and willfully presents a bill for non-physician or other bundled services not provided directly or under such an arrangement. This proposed rule also addresses the requirements for designating certain entities as provider-based or as a department of a hospital.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES', 'name': 'Health and Human Services Department', 'id': 221, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/health-and-human-services-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/221.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'health-and-human-services-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Health Care Financing Administration', 'name': 'Health Care Finance Administration', 'id': 559, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/health-care-finance-administration', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/559.json', 'parent_id': 221, 'slug': 'health-care-finance-administration'}, {'raw_name': 'Office of Inspector General'}]"," &#8230;  antibody

96-29558,"This final rule makes several policy changes affecting Medicare payment for physician services, including payment for diagnostic services and transportation in connection with furnishing diagnostic tests. The final rule also makes changes in geographic payment areas (localities) and changes in the procedure status codes for a variety of services. Since we established the physician fee schedule on January 1, 1992, our experience indicates that some of our policies may need to be reconsidered. This final rule is intended to correct several inequities in physician payment. This final rule also makes changes to work relative value units (RVUs) affecting payment for physician services. Section 1848(c)(2)(B)(i) of the Social Security Act requires that we review all work RVUs no less often than every 5 years. Since we implemented the physician fee schedule effective for services furnished beginning January 1, 1992, we have completed the 5-year review of work RVUs that will be effective for services furnished beginning January 1, 1997. In addition, we are finalizing the 1996 interim RVUs and are issuing interim RVUs for new and revised procedure codes for 1997. DATES: Effective Date: This rule is effective January 1, 1997, as provided by the Medicare statute. Ordinarily, 5 U.S.C. section 801 requires that agencies submit major rules to Congress 60 days before the rules are scheduled to become effective. However, the 104th Congress adjourned on October 4, 1996, and the 105th Congress is not scheduled to convene until January 7, 1997. The Department has concluded that, in this instance, a further delay in this rule's effective date in order to satisfy section 801 would not serve the law's intent, since Congress will not be in session during this period, and such delay in the effective date established by the Medicare statute is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. The Department finds, on this basis, that there is good cause for establishing this effective date pursuant to 5 U.S.C. section 808(2). Comment Date: We will accept comments on interim RVUs for selected procedure codes identified in Addendum C. Comments will be considered if we receive them at the appropriate address, as provided below, no later than 5 p.m. on January 21, 1997.","[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES', 'name': 'Health and Human Services Department', 'id': 221, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/health-and-human-services-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/221.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'health-and-human-services-department'}, {'raw_name': 'Health Care Financing Administration', 'name': 'Health Care Finance Administration', 'id': 559, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/health-care-finance-administration', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/559.json', 'parent_id': 221, 'slug': 'health-care-finance-administration'}]"," &#8230; .00        XXX  0

95-7355,"Section 120(c) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket. The docket is to contain certain information about Federal facilities that manage hazardous waste or from which hazardous substances have been or may be released. (As defined by CERCLA section 101(22), a release is any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing into the environment.) CERCLA requires that the docket be updated every six months, as new facilities are reported to EPA by Federal agencies. The following list identifies the Federal facilities to be included in the ninth update of the docket (that is, facilities not previously listed on the docket and reported to EPA since the last update of the docket, 58 Federal Register [F.R.] 59790, November 10, 1993, which was current as of July 16, 1993). EPA policy specifies that, for each Federal facility that is included on the docket during an update, the responsible Federal agency must complete a preliminary assessment (PA) and, if warranted, a site inspection (SI) within 18 months of publication of the notice. Such site evaluation activities will help determine whether the facility should be included on the National Priorities List (NPL) and will provide EPA and the public with valuable information about the facility. In addition to the list of additions to the docket, this notice includes a section that comprises revisions (that is, corrections and deletions) of the previous docket list and a list of the facilities on the docket that have been evaluated and determined to be not appropriate for listing on the NPL at this time (the no further remedial action planned [NFRAP] list).

The proposed changes are intended to ensure the safe transportation of infectious substances, provide relief from certain requirements of the hazardous materials regulations in those instances where other Federal agency regulations achieve an acceptable level of safety for transportation of RMW, and clarify provisions which were adopted in the December 1991 final rule.
