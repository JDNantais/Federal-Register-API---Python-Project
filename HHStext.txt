We are revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems for FY 2020 and to implement certain recent legislation. We also are making changes relating to Medicare graduate medical education (GME) for teaching hospitals and payments to critical access hospital (CAHs). In addition, we are providing the market basket update that will apply to the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis, subject to these limits for FY 2020. We are updating the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) for FY 2020. In this FY 2020 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule, we are addressing wage index disparities impacting low wage index hospitals; providing for an alternative IPPS new technology add-on payment pathway for certain transformative new devices and qualified infectious disease products; and revising the calculation of the IPPS new technology add-on payment. In addition, we are revising and clarifying our policies related to the substantial clinical improvement criterion used for evaluating applications for the new technology add-on payment under the IPPS. We are establishing new requirements or revising existing requirements for quality reporting by specific Medicare providers (acute care hospitals, PPS-exempt cancer hospitals, and LTCHs). We also are establishing new requirements and revising existing requirements for eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) participating in the Medicare and Medicaid Promoting Interoperability Programs. We are updating policies for the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, and the Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program.

The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) repeals the Medicare sustainable growth rate (SGR) methodology for updates to the physician fee schedule (PFS) and replaces it with a new approach to payment called the Quality Payment Program that rewards the delivery of high-quality patient care through two avenues: Advanced Alternative Payment Models (Advanced APMs) and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) for eligible clinicians or groups under the PFS. This final rule with comment period establishes incentives for participation in certain alternative payment models (APMs) and includes the criteria for use by the Physician-Focused Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee (PTAC) in making comments and recommendations on physician-focused payment models (PFPMs). Alternative Payment Models are payment approaches, developed in partnership with the clinician community, that provide added incentives to deliver high-quality and cost-efficient care. APMs can apply to a specific clinical condition, a care episode, or a population. This final rule with comment period also establishes the MIPS, a new program for certain Medicare-enrolled practitioners. MIPS will consolidate components of three existing programs, the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS), the Physician Value-based Payment Modifier (VM), and the Medicare Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program for Eligible Professionals (EPs), and will continue the focus on quality, cost, and use of certified EHR technology (CEHRT) in a cohesive program that avoids redundancies. In this final rule with comment period we have rebranded key terminology based on feedback from stakeholders, with the goal of selecting terms that will be more easily identified and understood by our stakeholders.

This proposed rule is being issued by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) in conjunction with the Department of Health and Human Services' Regulatory Sprint to Coordinated Care. It proposes to add, on a prospective basis only after a final rule is issued, safe harbor protections under the Federal anti-kickback statute for certain coordinated care and associated value-based arrangements between or among clinicians, providers, suppliers, and others that squarely meet all safe harbor conditions. It also would add protections under the anti-kickback statute and civil monetary penalty (CMP) law that prohibits inducements offered to patients for certain patient engagement and support arrangements to improve quality of care, health outcomes, and efficiency of care delivery that squarely meet all safe harbor conditions. The proposed rule would add a new safe harbor for donations of cybersecurity technology and amend the existing safe harbors for electronic health records (EHR) arrangements, warranties, local transportation, and personal services and management contracts. Further, the proposed rule would add a new safe harbor pursuant to a statutory change set forth in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Budget Act of 2018) related to beneficiary incentives under the Medicare Shared Savings Program and a new CMP exception for certain telehealth technologies offered to patients receiving in-home dialysis, also pursuant to the Budget Act of 2018.

Under the Medicare Shared Savings Program (Shared Savings Program), providers of services and suppliers that participate in an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) continue to receive traditional Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) payments under Parts A and B, but the ACO may be eligible to receive a shared savings payment if it meets specified quality and savings requirements. The policies included in this final rule provide a new direction for the Shared Savings Program by establishing pathways to success through redesigning the participation options available under the program to encourage ACOs to transition to two-sided models (in which they may share in savings and are accountable for repaying shared losses). These policies are designed to increase savings for the Trust Funds and mitigate losses, reduce gaming opportunities, and promote regulatory flexibility and free-market principles. This final rule also provides new tools to support coordination of care across settings and strengthen beneficiary engagement; and ensure rigorous benchmarking. In this final rule, we also respond to public comments we received on the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policies for the Shared Savings Program that were used to assess the quality and financial performance of ACOs that were subject to extreme and uncontrollable events, such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and the California wildfires, in performance year 2017, including the applicable quality data reporting period for performance year 2017.

This final rule implements three new Medicare Parts A and B episode payment models, a Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) Incentive Payment model and modifications to the existing Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement model under section 1115A of the Social Security Act. Acute care hospitals in certain selected geographic areas will participate in retrospective episode payment models targeting care for Medicare fee- for-service beneficiaries receiving services during acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, and surgical hip/femur fracture treatment episodes. All related care within 90 days of hospital discharge will be included in the episode of care. We believe these models will further our goals of improving the efficiency and quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries receiving care for these common clinical conditions and procedures.

The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) repeals the Medicare sustainable growth rate (SGR) methodology for updates to the physician fee schedule (PFS) and replaces it with a new approach to payment called the Quality Payment Program that rewards the delivery of high-quality patient care through two avenues: Advanced Alternative Payment Models (Advanced APMs) and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) for eligible clinicians or groups under the PFS. This final rule with comment period establishes incentives for participation in certain alternative payment models (APMs) and includes the criteria for use by the Physician-Focused Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee (PTAC) in making comments and recommendations on physician-focused payment models (PFPMs). Alternative Payment Models are payment approaches, developed in partnership with the clinician community, that provide added incentives to deliver high-quality and cost-efficient care. APMs can apply to a specific clinical condition, a care episode, or a population. This final rule with comment period also establishes the MIPS, a new program for certain Medicare-enrolled practitioners. MIPS will consolidate components of three existing programs, the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS), the Physician Value-based Payment Modifier (VM), and the Medicare Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program for Eligible Professionals (EPs), and will continue the focus on quality, cost, and use of certified EHR technology (CEHRT) in a cohesive program that avoids redundancies. In this final rule with comment period we have rebranded key terminology based on feedback from stakeholders, with the goal of selecting terms that will be more easily identified and understood by our stakeholders.

Under the Medicare Shared Savings Program (Shared Savings Program), providers of services and suppliers that participate in an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) continue to receive traditional Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) payments under Parts A and B, but the ACO may be eligible to receive a shared savings payment if it meets specified quality and savings requirements. This final rule addresses changes to the Shared Savings Program, including: Modifications to the program's benchmarking methodology, when resetting (rebasing) the ACO's benchmark for a second or subsequent agreement period, to encourage ACOs' continued investment in care coordination and quality improvement; an alternative participation option to encourage ACOs to enter performance-based risk arrangements earlier in their participation under the program; and policies for reopening of payment determinations to make corrections after financial calculations have been performed and ACO shared savings and shared losses for a performance year have been determined.

Under the Medicare Shared Savings Program (Shared Savings Program), providers of services and suppliers that participate in an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) continue to receive traditional Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) payments under Parts A and B, but the ACO may be eligible to receive a shared savings payment if it meets specified quality and savings requirements. This proposed rule addresses changes to the Shared Savings Program that would modify the program's benchmark rebasing methodology to encourage ACOs' continued investment in care coordination and quality improvement, and identifies publicly available data to support modeling and analysis of these proposed changes. In addition, it would streamline the methodology used to adjust an ACO's historical benchmark for changes in its ACO participant composition, offer an alternative participation option to encourage ACOs to enter performance-based risk arrangements earlier in their participation under the program, and establish policies for reopening of payment determinations to make corrections after financial calculations have been performed and ACO shared savings and shared losses for a performance year have been determined.

This final rule implements a new Medicare Part A and B payment model under section 1115A of the Social Security Act, called the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model, in which acute care hospitals in certain selected geographic areas will receive retrospective bundled payments for episodes of care for lower extremity joint replacement (LEJR) or reattachment of a lower extremity. All related care within 90 days of hospital discharge from the joint replacement procedure will be included in the episode of care. We believe this model will further our goals in improving the efficiency and quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries with these common medical procedures.

As explained in greater detail below, in light of legislative changes that occurred after publication of the IFC, this final rule does not finalize waivers of the application of the CMP law provision relating to ``gainsharing'' arrangements. Section 1899(f) of the Act, as added by the Affordable Care Act, authorizes the Secretary to waive certain fraud and abuse laws as necessary to carry out the provisions of section 1899 of the Act.

This proposed rule would modernize the Medicaid managed care regulations to reflect changes in the usage of managed care delivery systems. The proposed rule would align the rules governing Medicaid managed care with those of other major sources of coverage, including coverage through Qualified Health Plans and Medicare Advantage plans; implement statutory provisions; strengthen actuarial soundness payment provisions to promote the accountability of Medicaid managed care program rates; and promote the quality of care and strengthen efforts to reform delivery systems that serve Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries. It would also ensure appropriate beneficiary protections and enhance policies related to program integrity. This proposed rule would also require states to establish comprehensive quality strategies for their Medicaid and CHIP programs regardless of how services are provided to beneficiaries. This proposed rule would also implement provisions of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) and addresses third party liability for trauma codes.

In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, we are proposing to modify an existing SOR titled, ``Chronic Condition Data Repository (CCDR), System No. 09-70-0573'' last published at 71 FR 54495, September 15, 2006. The current name of the SOR, Chronic Condition Data Repository, was developed during the planning and development stages of the system. Upon the implementation and throughout the operations and maintenance stages of the system, the system has been referred to as the Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW) in common usage and written references. In keeping with this current usage, we will modify the name of this SOR to read, and from this point forward will refer to the system as: ``Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW).'' We propose to broaden the scope of the system to include data that can be easily linked, at the individual patient level, to all Medicare and Medicaid claims, enrollment and/or eligibility data, nursing home and home health assessments, and CMS beneficiary survey data. Accordingly, we are updating the Authority Section to include Title XVIII of the Social Security Act as amended (the Act); Section 1902(a)(6) of the Act; Section 1142(c)(6) of the Act; and Title IV of the Balanced Budget Act (Pub. L. 105-33). The Record Source Categories section will be modified to include data from two new systems of records: the CMS Encounter Data System, System No. 09-70-0506, and the National Death Index, System No. 09-20-0166. These modifications will make the CCW a more useful tool by which to support research, policy analysis, quality improvement activities, and demonstrations that attempt to foster a better understanding of how to improve the quality of life and contain the health care costs of the chronically ill. We propose to modify existing Routine Use Number 1, to limit disclosures only to contractors of CMS. We also propose to add two new routine uses. Specifically, we propose adding a routine use to permit disclosures to healthcare providers who seek patient information for use in care coordination and quality improvement activities as described at 45 CFR 164.506(c)(4). This routine use will be added as Routine Use Number 4. We also propose adding a routine use to support public or private Qualified Entities (QEs) that use Medicare claims data to evaluate the performance of providers of services and suppliers on measures of quality, efficiency, effectiveness, and resource use. This routine use will be added as routine use number 6. Finally, we are modifying the language in Routine Use Number 3 to include grantees of CMS administered grant programs and have made minor grammatical changes to Routine Use Number 10. These modifications will provide a better explanation as to the need for the routine use, and to clearly state CMS's intention when making disclosures of individually identifiable information contained in this system. We have provided background information about the modified system in the Supplementary Information section below. Although the Privacy Act requires only that the ``Routine Use'' section of the system of records notice be published for comment, CMS invites comments on all portions of this notice. See the Effective Dates section for information on the comment period.	Privacy Act of 1974; Report of Modified System of Records

We are revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. Some of these changes implement certain statutory provisions contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act), the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, and other legislation. These changes are applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014, unless otherwise specified in this final rule. We also are updating the rate- of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The updated rate-of-increase limits are effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2014. We also are updating the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and implementing certain statutory changes to the LTCH PPS under the Affordable Care Act and the Pathway for Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) Reform Act of 2013 and the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014. In addition, we discuss our proposals on the interruption of stay policy for LTCHs and on retiring the ``5 percent'' payment adjustment for co-located LTCHs. While many of the statutory mandates of the Pathway for SGR Reform Act apply to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014, others will not begin to apply until 2016 and beyond. In addition, we are making a number of changes relating to direct graduate medical education (GME) and indirect medical education (IME) payments. We are establishing new requirements or revising requirements for quality reporting by specific providers (acute care hospitals, PPS- exempt cancer hospitals, and LTCHs) that are participating in Medicare. We are updating policies relating to the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, and the Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program. In addition, we are making technical corrections to the regulations governing provider administrative appeals and judicial review; updating the reasonable compensation equivalent (RCE) limits, and revising the methodology for determining such limits, for services furnished by physicians to certain teaching hospitals and hospitals excluded from the IPPS; making regulatory revisions to broaden the specified uses of Medicare Advantage (MA) risk adjustment data and to specify the conditions for release of such risk adjustment data to entities outside of CMS; and making changes to the enforcement procedures for organ transplant centers. We are aligning the reporting and submission timelines for clinical quality measures for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program for eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) with the reporting and submission timelines for the Hospital IQR Program. In addition, we provide guidance and clarification of certain policies for eligible hospitals and CAHs such as our policy for reporting zero denominators on clinical quality measures and our policy for case threshold exemptions. In this document, we are finalizing two interim final rules with comment period relating to criteria for disproportionate share hospital uncompensated care payments and extensions of temporary changes to the payment adjustment for low-volume hospitals and of the Medicare- Dependent, Small Rural Hospital (MDH) Program.

Each year annual epidemics of influenza occur in the United States. However, variations in the timing and intensity of the season occur each year. Early insights into the timing of the beginning, the peak, and the intensity of the influenza season would be very useful in planning vaccination campaigns, targeting resources and therefore reducing costs associated with influenza prevention and control, and communicating prevention messages to the public. Mathematical and statistical models can be useful in predicting the timing and impact of the influenza season, but no models published to date have successfully predicted key influenza season milestones with sufficient accuracy. The Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDC would like to invest in innovation through the research and development of mathematical and statistical models that use digital surveillance data (e.g. Twitter, internet search data, web surveys, etc.) to predict the timing, peak, and intensity of the upcoming influenza season. By hosting this challenge, the Influenza Division is able to garner the technical innovation required to accurately forecast the influenza season for less resources than would be required through more traditional mechanisms. Furthermore, this challenge will allow the Influenza Division to foster competition and receive and evaluate multiple influenza season forecasts from a number of scientists using a variety of different methodologies, which would not be possible if a single entity were funded. Accurate influenza forecasts have the potential to reduce long-term costs by more efficiently utilizing resources that are available to track influenza and implement control measures during the influenza season. The challenge could be solved by applying any mathematical, statistical, or other approach to predictive modeling. This challenge will provide the Influenza Division with methods that advance the science of prediction modeling, enhance the understanding of influenza modeling and the use of digital data for influenza surveillance, and improve the implementation of prevention and control measures for seasonal influenza. The historical national surveillance data that could be used to enable training and correlation model development by competitors are available at http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html and are updated every Friday at noon. The competitors' predictions and methodology describing their models will comprise their initial challenge entry. Eight subsequent bi-weekly submissions of predictions based on the submitted methodology are also required. Predictions must be national in scope but may also include HHS region predictions; all predictions must be scaled to ILINet. Competitors' models will be evaluated based on the methodology and how well the predictions match the 2013-14 influenza season as measured by the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet: http:// www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm#Outpatient). The competition will award a $75,000 prize and singular recognition to the person or team that most closely predicts the influenza season.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed, among other things, to classify Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA) on the basis of findings and recommendations of the Panel on Review of Bacterial Vaccines and Toxoids (the Panel) on December 13, 1985. The Panel reviewed the safety, efficacy, and labeling of bacterial vaccines and toxoids with standards of potency, bacterial antitoxins, and immune globulins. After the initial final rule and final order was vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on October 27, 2004, FDA published a new proposed rule and proposed order on December 29, 2004. The purpose of this final order is to categorize AVA according to the evidence of its safety and effectiveness, thereby determining if it may remain licensed and on the market; issue a final response to recommendations made in the Panel's report, and; respond to comments on the previously published proposed order. The final rule and final order concerning bacterial vaccines and toxoids other than AVA is published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register.

This interim final rule sets forth the State requirements to provide information to us for purposes of estimating improper payments in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), as required under the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002. The IPIA requires heads of Federal agencies to annually estimate and report to the Congress these estimates of improper payments for the programs they oversee and, submit a report on actions the agency is taking to reduce erroneous payments. We published a proposed rule on August 27, 2004 to propose that States measure improper payments in Medicaid and SCHIP and report the State-specific error rates to us for purposes of computing the improper payment estimates for these programs. After extensive analysis of the issues related to having States measure improper payments in Medicaid and SCHIP, including public comments on the provisions in the proposed rule, we are revising our proposed approach. Our new approach incorporates commenters' suggestions to engage a Federal contractor by contracting with that entity to complete the data processing and medical reviews and calculate the State-specific error rates. Based on the States' error rates, the contractor also will calculate the improper payment estimates for these programs which will be reported by the Department of Health and Human Services as required by the IPIA. This interim final rule sets out the types of information that States would need to submit to allow CMS to conduct medical and data processing reviews on claims made in the fee-for-service (FFS) setting. CMS will address estimating improper payments for Medicaid managed care and eligibility and SCHIP FFS, managed care and eligibility at a later time. This rule responds to the public comments on the proposed rule, sets forth the requirements for States to assist us and the contractor to produce State-specific error rates in Medicaid and SCHIP which will be used as the basis for a national error rate, and outlines future plans for measuring eligibility, which may include greater State involvement than the level required for the medical and data processing reviews.

The National Cancer Institute seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with a software company with demonstrated excellence in the development and deployment of software applications for the enterprise and individuals. NCI has recently developed a powerful but user-friendly computer-based system which enables its users to create, use and share a knowledge base of information consisting of diverse objects related to each other by semantically meaningful links. This system, provisionally called ``KBTool'', can be considered a new class of software application since it is sufficiently different from existing applications. The system provides a knowledge base that is seamless, allowing individuals to store information on a virtually unlimited range of objects and concepts. In addition, dense and informative links between many types of concepts are constructed. The system is extensible so that it is suited for use in distributed systems in which information is shared between users and stored at different physical locations. Because of the power of the system and its relevance to many domains of knowledge and types of applications, the NCI is seeking a commercial partner for its continued development and deployment. The software was originally created to organize and link vast quantities of scientific data; however, NCI predicts that KBTool's functionality will be applicable to a wide variety of fields. The Collaborator must have a demonstrated record of success in privately producing and marketing information resources.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is issuing this final action establishing that certain active ingredients used in nonprescription (also known as over-the-counter (OTC)) consumer antiseptic products intended for use without water (referred to throughout as consumer antiseptic rubs or consumer rubs) are not eligible for evaluation under the OTC Drug Review for use in consumer antiseptic rubs. Drug products containing these ineligible active ingredients will require approval under a new drug application (NDA) or abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) prior to marketing. FDA is issuing this final action after considering the recommendations of the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee (NDAC), public comments on the Agency's notices of proposed rulemaking, and all data and information on OTC consumer antiseptic rub products that have come to the Agency's attention. This final action finalizes the 1994 tentative final monograph (TFM) for OTC consumer antiseptic rub drug products that published in the Federal Register of June 17, 1994 (the 1994 TFM), as amended by the proposed rule published in the Federal Register (FR) of June 30, 2016 (2016 Consumer Antiseptic Rub proposed rule).

This proposed rule would implement certain provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act, including conditions and maintenance of certification requirements for health information technology (health IT) developers under the ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program), the voluntary certification of health IT for use by pediatric health care providers, and reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking. The implementation of these provisions would advance interoperability and support the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information. The proposed rule would also modify the 2015 Edition health IT certification criteria and Program in additional ways to advance interoperability, enhance health IT certification, and reduce burden and costs.	21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program
We are revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems for FY 2019. Some of these changes implement certain statutory provisions contained in the 21st Century Cures Act and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and other legislation. We also are making changes relating to Medicare graduate medical education (GME) affiliation agreements for new urban teaching hospitals. In addition, we are providing the market basket update that will apply to the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis, subject to these limits for FY 2019. We are updating the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long- term care hospitals (LTCHs) for FY 2019. In addition, we are establishing new requirements or revising existing requirements for quality reporting by specific Medicare providers (acute care hospitals, PPS-exempt cancer hospitals, and LTCHs). We also are establishing new requirements or revising existing requirements for eligible professionals (EPs), eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals (CAHs) participating in the Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Programs (now referred to as the Promoting Interoperability Programs). In addition, we are finalizing modifications to the requirements that apply to States operating Medicaid Promoting Interoperability Programs. We are updating policies for the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, and the Hospital- Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program. We also are making changes relating to the required supporting documentation for an acceptable Medicare cost report submission and the supporting information for physician certification and recertification of claims.
