2019-08330,"We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems for FY 2020 and to implement certain recent legislation. We also are proposing to make changes relating to Medicare graduate medical education (GME) for teaching hospitals and payments to critical access hospital (CAHs). In addition, we are proposing to provide the market basket update that would apply to the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis, subject to these limits for FY 2020. We are proposing to update the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) for FY 2020. In this proposed rule, we are including proposals to address wage index disparities between high and low wage index hospitals; to provide for an alternative IPPS new technology add-on payment pathway for certain transformative new devices; and to revise the calculation of the IPPS new technology add-on payment. In addition, we are requesting public comments on the substantial clinical improvement criterion used for evaluating applications for both the IPPS new technology add-on payment and the OPPS transitional pass- through payment for devices, and we discuss potential revisions that we are considering adopting as final policies related to the substantial clinical improvement criterion for applications received beginning in FY 2020 for IPPS (that is, for FY 2021 and later new technology add-on payments) and beginning in CY 2020 for the OPPS. We are proposing to establish new requirements or revise existing requirements for quality reporting by specific Medicare providers (acute care hospitals, PPS-exempt cancer hospitals, and LTCHs). We also are proposing to establish new requirements and revise existing requirements for eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) participating in the Medicare and Medicaid Promoting Interoperability Programs.

The fall editions of the Unified Agenda include the agency regulatory plans required by E.O. 12866, which identify regulatory priorities and provide additional detail about the most important significant regulatory actions that agencies expect to take in the coming year. In addition, the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that agencies publish semiannual ``regulatory flexibility agendas'' describing regulatory actions they are developing that will have significant effects on small businesses and other small entities (5 U.S.C. 602). The Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified Agenda), published in the fall and spring, helps agencies fulfill all of these requirements. All federal regulatory agencies have chosen to publish their regulatory agendas as part of this publication. The complete Unified Agenda and Regulatory Plan can be found online at http://www.reginfo.gov and a reduced print version can be found in the Federal Register. Information regarding obtaining printed copies can also be found on the Reginfo.gov Web site (or below, VI. How can users get copies of the Plan and the Agenda?).

2016-25240,"The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) repeals the Medicare sustainable growth rate (SGR) methodology for updates to the physician fee schedule (PFS) and replaces it with a new approach to payment called the Quality Payment Program that rewards the delivery of high-quality patient care through two avenues: Advanced Alternative Payment Models (Advanced APMs) and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) for eligible clinicians or groups under the PFS. This final rule with comment period establishes incentives for participation in certain alternative payment models (APMs) and includes the criteria for use by the Physician-Focused Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee (PTAC) in making comments and recommendations on physician-focused payment models (PFPMs). Alternative Payment Models are payment approaches, developed in partnership with the clinician community, that provide added incentives to deliver high-quality and cost-efficient care. APMs can apply to a specific clinical condition, a care episode, or a population. This final rule with comment period also establishes the MIPS, a new program for certain Medicare-enrolled practitioners. MIPS will consolidate components of three existing programs, the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS), the Physician Value-based Payment Modifier (VM), and the Medicare Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program for Eligible Professionals (EPs), and will continue the focus on quality, cost, and use of certified EHR technology (CEHRT) in a cohesive program that avoids redundancies.

This mission is a continuation of two consecutive Health IT missions to Brazil and part of a sustained effort to help U.S. companies access the Brazilian Health IT market. Further, CS Brazil will work with leading Brazilian health media company, Live Media, and the Brazilian Health Informatics Association (SBIS) to organize an e-Health conference, which will be held in Sao Paulo at the same time as the trade mission. U.S. trade mission delegates will participate in the conference as part of the trade mission. The purpose of the trade mission is to introduce U.S. firms to Brazil's rapidly expanding market for Health IT products, services and solutions and to assist U.S. companies in the pursuit of export opportunities in this sector. The trade mission to Brazil is designed for U.S. Health IT solution providers, particularly small- and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs), interested in long-term business opportunities in Brazil, as well as the trade associations/ organizations that represent them. Target sectors holding high potential for U.S exporters include: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Health IT interoperability system integration services, patient security, Health IT architecture design services, cyber security solutions, IoT solution providers, cloud solutions, clinical software, big data, clinical decision support, health analytics, health care transformation consulting, telehealth, smart mobile devices and mobile health applications, M2M connected devices, communication solutions, education of Health IT students and workforce training. Trade mission delegates will participate in a five-day program, including technical visits to hospitals, roundtables and policy meetings with public health officials in Sao Paulo and Recife. In addition, on September 27, as part of the trade mission, delegates will participate in a one-day technology seminar at the e-Health Conference in Sao Paulo, thus giving the delegation heightened exposure to potential clients and partners from countries around the world. (Note that admission to the e-Health Conference September 27-28 is included in the Trade Mission fee). The delegates will also have networking opportunities to meet face-to-face with potential strategic partners, systems integrators, value added resellers (VAR's), hospital decision makers, planners and public health officials at the federal, state and city levels. This mission supports President Obama's National Export Initiative (NEI). The mission will help new-to-market companies learn about the Brazilian Health IT market and make initial contacts. It will also support U.S. companies already doing business in Brazil to increase their footprint and deepen their business interests. The mission will also help participating firms and associations/organizations gain market insights, make industry contacts, implement business strategies, and advance specific projects, with the goal of increasing U.S. exports of products and services to Brazil.",Notice.,"[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE', 'name': 'Commerce Department', 'id': 54, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/commerce-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/54.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'commerce-department'}, {'raw_name': 'International Trade Administration', 'name': 'International Trade Administration', 'id': 261, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/international-trade-administration', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/261.json', 'parent_id': 54, 'slug': 'international-trade-administration'}]","['Commerce Department', 'International Trade Administration']",,2016-06-30,,,"Health IT Trade Mission to Brazil September 26-30, 2016",[],Notice,Big Data

This Directive affirms the fundamental responsibilities of Federal statistical agencies and recognized statistical units in the design, collection, processing, editing, compilation, storage, analysis, release, and dissemination of statistical information. On May 21, 2014, OMB published a Notice of solicitation of comments on a draft of this Directive in the Federal Register (79 FR 29308, May 21, 2014). Eight respondents sent comments in regard to the notice. Careful consideration was given to all comments. The disposition of the comments as well as the final Directive are presented in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section below. In its role as coordinator of the Federal statistical system under the Paperwork Reduction Act, OMB, among other responsibilities, is required to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of the system as well as the integrity, objectivity, impartiality, utility, and confidentiality of information collected for statistical purposes. OMB is also charged with developing and overseeing the implementation of Government-wide principles, policies, standards, and guidelines concerning the development, presentation, and dissemination of statistical information. The Information Quality Act (Pub. L. 106-554, Division C, title V, Sec. 515, Dec. 21, 2000; 114 Stat. 2763A-153 to 2763A-154) requires OMB, as well as all other Federal agencies, to maximize the objectivity, utility, and integrity of information, including statistical information, provided to the public. To operate efficiently and effectively, the Nation relies on the flow of objective, credible statistics to support the decisions of individuals, households, governments, businesses, and other organizations. Any loss of trust in the accuracy, objectivity, or integrity of the Federal statistical system and its products causes uncertainty about the validity of measures the Nation uses to monitor and assess its performance, progress, and needs by undermining the public's confidence in the information released by the Government. Although the Federal Government has taken a number of legislative and executive actions, informed by national and international practice, to maintain public confidence in Federal statistics, the actual implementation in the form of standards and practices can involve a wide range of managerial and technical challenges. Therefore, to support the quality and objectivity of Federal statistical information, OMB is issuing a new Statistical Policy Directive to affirm the long-acknowledged, fundamental responsibilities of Federal statistical agencies and recognized statistical units in the design, collection, processing, editing, compilation, storage, analysis, release, and dissemination of statistical information. Additional discussion of the Directive, together with the Directive itself, may be found in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section below.",Notice of final decision.,"[{'raw_name': 'OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET', 'name': 'Management and Budget Office', 'id': 280, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/management-and-budget-office', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/280.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'management-and-budget-office'}]",['Management and Budget Office'],,2014-12-02,,,Statistical Policy Directive No. 1: Fundamental Responsibilities of Federal Statistical Agencies and Recognized Statistical Units,[],Notice,Big Data
