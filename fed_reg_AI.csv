2018-00671,"NHTSA seeks public comments to identify any regulatory barriers in the existing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) to the testing, compliance certification and compliance verification of motor vehicles with Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) and certain unconventional interior designs. NHTSA is focusing primarily, but not exclusively, on vehicles with ADSs that lack controls for a human driver; e.g., steering wheel, brake pedal or accelerator pedal. The absence of manual driving controls, and thus of a human driver, poses potential barriers to testing, compliance certification and compliance verification. For example, many of the FMVSS refer to the ``driver'' or ``driver's seating position'' in specifying where various vehicle features and systems need to be located so that they can be seen and/or used by a person sitting in that position. Further, the compliance test procedures of some FMVSS depend on the presence of such things as a human test driver who can follow instructions on test driving maneuvers or a steering wheel that can be used by an automated steering machine. NHTSA also seeks comments on the research that would be needed to determine how to amend the FMVSS in order to remove such barriers, while retaining those existing safety requirements that will be needed and appropriate for those vehicles. In all cases, the Agency's goal would be to ensure the maintenance of currently required levels of safety performance.

The proposed amendments would provide various benefits to participants in those programs, including: Improved processes for U.S. employers seeking to sponsor and retain immigrant and nonimmigrant workers, greater stability and job flexibility for such workers, and increased transparency and consistency in the application of agency policy related to affected classifications. Many of these changes are primarily aimed at improving the ability of U.S. employers to hire and retain high-skilled workers who are beneficiaries of approved employment-based immigrant visa petitions and are waiting to become lawful permanent residents (LPRs), while increasing the ability of such workers to seek promotions, accept lateral positions with current employers, change employers, or pursue other employment options. First, DHS proposes to amend its regulations consistent with certain worker portability and other provisions in the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 (AC21), as amended, as well as the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (ACWIA). These proposed amendments would clarify and improve longstanding agency policies and procedures-- previously articulated in agency memoranda and precedent decisions-- implementing sections of AC21 and ACWIA related to certain foreign workers, including sections specific to workers who have been sponsored for LPR status by their employers. In so doing, the proposed rule would enhance consistency among agency adjudicators and provide a primary repository of governing rules for the regulated community. In addition, the proposed rule would clarify several interpretive questions raised by AC21 and ACWIA. Second, consistent with existing DHS authorities and the goals of AC21 and ACWIA, DHS proposes to amend its regulations governing certain employment-based immigrant and nonimmigrant visa programs to provide additional stability and flexibility to employers and workers in those programs. The proposed rule would, among other things: improve job portability for certain beneficiaries of approved employment-based immigrant visa petitions by limiting the grounds for automatic revocation of petition approval; further enhance job portability for such beneficiaries by increasing their ability to retain their priority dates for use with subsequently approved employment-based immigrant visa petitions; establish or extend grace periods for certain high- skilled nonimmigrant workers so that they may more easily maintain their nonimmigrant status when changing employment opportunities; and provide additional stability and flexibility to certain high-skilled workers by allowing those who are working in the United States in certain nonimmigrant statuses, are the beneficiaries of approved employment-based immigrant visa petitions, are subject to immigrant visa backlogs, and demonstrate compelling circumstances to independently apply for employment authorization for a limited period. These and other proposed changes would provide much needed flexibility to the beneficiaries of employment-based immigrant visa petitions, as well as the U.S. employers who employ and sponsor them for permanent residence. Finally, to provide additional certainty and stability to certain employment-authorized individuals and their U.S. employers, DHS is also proposing changes to its regulations governing the processing of applications for employment authorization to minimize the risk of any gaps in such authorization. These changes would provide for the automatic extension of the validity of certain Employment Authorization Documents (EADs or Forms I-766) for an interim period upon the timely filing of an application to renew such documents. At the same time, in light of national security and fraud concerns, DHS is proposing to remove regulations that provide a 90-day processing timeline for EAD applications and that require the issuance of interim EADs if processing extends beyond the 90-day mark.",Proposed rule.,"[{'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY', 'name': 'Homeland Security Department', 'id': 227, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/homeland-security-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/227.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'homeland-security-department'}]",['Homeland Security Department'],,2015-12-31,False,,"Retention of EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 Immigrant Workers and Program Improvements Affecting High-Skilled Nonimmigrant Workers","['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Adoption and foster care', 'Aliens', 'Cultural exchange programs', 'Employment', 'Foreign officials', 'Health professions', 'Immigration', 'Penalties', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Students']",Proposed Rule,Artificial Intelligence

96-14329,"In this final rule, the Department of Housing and Urban Development is revising Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA). This rule completes a process that started with a public hearing and comment period on August 6, 1993, followed by a proposed rule published on July 21, 1994. In the interest of protecting consumers from practices prohibited by RESPA, while making available to consumers the potential benefits of innovative business arrangements, this rule withdraws an exemption for employer-employee payments, introduces two more-limited exemptions for payments that would otherwise be prohibited by the statute--employer payments to managerial employees and employees who do not perform settlement services in any transaction. In addition, to relieve any uncertainty, the rule adds an additional exemption to clarify that payments made to an employer's own bona fide employee for generating business for that employer are permissible. The rule also revises certain controlled business disclosure requirements. HUD has chosen to use its exemption authority under Section 8(c)(5) of RESPA, having consulted with other Federal agencies as required by that provision, as well as the authority under Section 19(a) of RESPA, to permit these payments. The rule also withdraws an exemption for payments made by borrowers for computer loan origination (CLO) services, because the exemption was found to be of little benefit to consumers or the loan origination industry. However, in order to assure that consumers in the mortgage lending marketplace continue to benefit from technological innovation, simultaneously with the publication of this rule, the Department is issuing a Statement of Policy analyzing payments for CLOs under the RESPA regulations. In addition, the Department is simultaneously publishing two other Statements of Policy on issues raised by comments on the proposed rule, although not directly related to the proposed rule, and which involve interpretation rather than new rulemaking.",Final rule.,"[{'raw_name': 'Final Rules'}, {'raw_name': 'DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT', 'name': 'Housing and Urban Development Department', 'id': 228, 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/housing-and-urban-development-department', 'json_url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/228.json', 'parent_id': None, 'slug': 'housing-and-urban-development-department'}]","['Final Rules', 'Housing and Urban Development Department']",1996-10-07,1996-06-07,True,,"Office of the Assistant Secretary for HousingFederal Housing Commissioner; Amendments to Regulation X, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act: Withdrawal of Employer-Employee and Computer Loan Origination Systems (CLOs) Exemptions",[],Rule,Artificial Intelligence
